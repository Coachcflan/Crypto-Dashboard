0,bitcoin,"What is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. It is a decentralized digital currency that is based on cryptography. As such, it can operate without the need of a central authority like a central bank or a company. It is unlike government-issued or fiat currencies such as US Dollars or Euro in which they are controlled by the country’s central bank. The decentralized nature allows it to operate on a peer-to-peer network whereby users are able to send funds to each other without going through intermediaries.

For more information on Bitcoin, do read CoinGecko's How to Bitcoin book.
Who created Bitcoin?
The creator is an unknown individual or group that goes by the name Satoshi Nakamoto with the idea of an electronic peer-to-peer cash system as it is written in a whitepaper. Until today, the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto has not been verified though there has been speculation and rumor as to who Satoshi might be.
When was Bitcoin launched?
It was launched in January 2009 with the first genesis block mined on 9th January 2009.
How does Bitcoin work?
While the general public perceives Bitcoin as some kind of physical looking coin, it is actually far from that. Under the hood, it is actually a distributed accounting ledger that is stored in a form of a chain of blocks, hence the name blockchain.
In a centralized system like the ones operated by a commercial bank, given a situation where Alice wants to transact with Bob, the bank is the only entity that holds the ledger that describes how much balance Alice and Bob has. As the bank maintains the ledger, they will do the verification as to whether Alice has enough funds to send to Bob. Finally when the transaction successfully takes place, the Bank will deduct Alice’s account and credit Bob’s account with the latest amount.
Bitcoin conversely works in a decentralized manner. Since there is no central figure like a bank to verify the transactions and maintain the ledger, a copy of the ledger is distributed across Bitcoin nodes. A node is a piece of software that anybody can download and run to participate in the network. With that, everybody has a copy of how much balance Alice and Bob has, and there will be no dispute of fund balance.
Now, if Alice were to transact with Bob using bitcoin. Alice will have to broadcast her transaction to the network that she intends to send $1 to Bob in equivalent amount of bitcoin. How would the system be able to determine that she has enough bitcoin to execute the transaction and also to ensure she does not double spend that same amount.
Here is where mining takes place. A Bitcoin miner will use his or her computer rigs to validate Alice’s transaction to be added into the ledger. In order to stop a miner from adding any arbitrary transactions, they will need to solve a complex puzzle. Only if the miner is able to solve the puzzle (called the Proof of Work), which happens at random, then he or she is able to add the transactions into the ledger and the record is final.
Since running these computer rigs cost money due to capital expenditure for buying the rigs and the cost of electricity, miners are rewarded with new supply of bitcoins that is part of its monetary system and some amount of fees paid by the person who wishes to transact (in this case it is Alice).
This makes the Bitcoin ledger resilient against fraud in a trustless manner. While it is resilient, there are still some risks associated with the system such as the 51% attack where by miners control more than 51% of the total computation power and also there can be security risks outside of the control of the Bitcoin protocol.

How to keep your Bitcoin safe?
When transacting coins, you would typically be doing it on your personal computer. Since your personal computer is connected to the internet, it has the potential to be infected by malware or spywares which could compromise your funds. 
Hardware wallets such as Trezor and Ledger are strongly encouraged in mitigating that risk. These are external devices that look like USB sticks. A hardware wallet secures your private key that holds your Bitcoin into an external device outside of your personal computer. When you intend to transact, you would connect the hardware wallet into your personal computer, and all the key signing in order to transact would be done in the hardware itself outside of your computer.
However, if you physically lose your hardware wallet without a key phrase backup, there is no other way of recovering your funds ever. As such when setting up your hardware wallet, always remember to keep a copy of the key phrase and put it somewhere safe from fire or flood.
Bitcoin Halving
Bitcoin Halving or sometimes also known as the Halvening, refers to the reduction of block reward to miners by half. This is part of its built-in monetary policy, in which after every approximately 4 years, the mining reward will be halved towards the limited capped supply of 21 million Bitcoin. Once 21 million of Bitcoin have been minted, there will no longer be new supply of it rewarded to miners, and miners are expected to earn revenue by way of transaction fees.
In order to follow the real time of when the halving will take place, you can bookmark the CoinGecko's bitcoin halving page.
This is seen as a significant event for couple of reasons. Firstly, traders may speculate on the possible scarcity of Bitcoin making way to high volatility. Secondly, as miners' rewards will be reduced, we may see some miners exiting the market as they could not sustain the lower profitability. This in turn may cause the hashing rate to reduce and mining pools may consolidate. Due to this, the bitcoin network may be a little unstable during the halving period.
Is Bitcoin a good investment?
We do not provide investment advice. The price of bitcoin started off as zero and made its way to the market price you see today. It appears that the market is placing value for the following reasons.

 Digital Gold - It is a viable digital store of value due to its digital scarcity
 Payment - Almost instant and low cost transaction with anyone on the internet
 Speculation - This may be due to inefficiency in the market, but there are people speculating that Bitcoin may be the asset class of the future

That being said, Bitcoin comes with risks. In order to determine for yourself if it is a good investment, it is important to understand the risk and only invest amount that you are comfortable losing.
There is a probability of Bitcoin price going to zero. This can happen if the project fails, a critical software bug is found, or there are newer more innovative digital currencies that would take over its place. If you recall Bitcoin was worth nearly $20,000 in 16th December 2017. But in 17th December 2018, the price of Bitcoin was at its low of about $3,200. Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset class and requires a high risk appetite.
As much as Bitcoin is a digital gold, it has only been around for about 10 years. In comparison to gold which has been a widely known store of value for over hundreds of years.
Can I short Bitcoin?
Yes, as bitcoin has grown to become more widely adopted, there are various derivative products being launched that allows you to short sell bitcoin. If you are an institutional investor, CME and Bakkt provide regulated bitcoin futures products which you can participate to long or short bitcoin. Alternatively, there are many other cryptocurrency derivative exchanges such as BitMEX, Binance Futures, FTX, Deribit, and more. These derivative exchanges are not formally regulated and can provide even up to 100x leverage. Derivative contracts are high risk products, you might want to understand what you are doing before participating in it.

1,ethereum,"What is Ethereum?
Ethereum is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications. In other words, the vision is to create a world computer that anyone can build applications in a decentralized manner; while all states and data are distributed and publicly accessible. Ethereum supports smart contracts in which developers can write code in order to program digital value. Examples of decentralized apps (dapps) that are built on Ethereum includes token, non-fungible tokens, decentralized finance apps, lending protocol, decentralized exchanges, and much more.
What is a Smart Contract?
A smart contract is a programmable contract that allows two counterparties to set conditions of a transaction without needing to trust another third party for the execution. 
For example, if Alice wants to set up a trust fund to pay Bob $100 at the start of each month for the next 12 months, she can program a smart contract to:

 Check the current date 
 At the start of each month, send Bob $100 automatically
 Repeat until the fund in the smart contract is exhausted

Using a smart contract, Alice has bypassed the need to have a trusted third-party intermediary (lawyers, escrow agents etc) to send the trust fund to Bob and made the process transparent to all involved parties.
Smart contracts work on the “if this, then that” principle. Whenever a certain condition is fulfilled, the smart contract will carry out the operation as programmed.
What are the programming languages that are used to write smart contracts on Ethereum?
There are two popular programming languages that are typically used to write Ethereum smart contracts. The first one is called Solidity which has very close similarities to Javascript and C++. The other language is called Vyper which is relatively new that has very close similarities to Python.
Who created Ethereum?
Unlike Bitcoin in which the creator who is known as Satoshi Nakamoto is unknown. The founding team of Ethereum are known individuals which includes Vitalik Buterin, Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di lorio, Charles Hoskinson, Amir Chetrit, Joseph Lubin, Gavin Wood, and Jeffrey Wilke. Not all the founding members are still with the Ethereum Foundation, as some has moved on to work on other projects. For example, Charles Hoskinson has moved on to work on Cardano, while Gavin Wood has moved on to work on Polkadot.
What is Ether?
While Ethereum refers to the blockchain network. The native currency that flows within the Ethereum economy is called Ether (ETH). Ether is typically used to pay for transaction fees called Gas, and it is the base currency of the network.
Ethereum Gas Fees
On Ethereum, all transactions and smart contract executions require a small fee to be paid. This fee is called Gas. In technical terms, Gas refers to the unit of measure on the amount of computational effort required to execute an operation or a smart contract. The more complex the execution operation is, the more gas is required to fulfill that operation. Gas fees are paid entirely in ETH. 
The price of gas can fluctuate from time to time depending on the network demand. If there are more people interacting on the Ethereum blockchain such as transacting in ETH or executing a smart contract operation, due to the limited amount of computing resources on the network, Gas price can increase. Conversely when the network is under utilized, the market price of gas would decrease.
What options are there to store Ether and ERC-20 tokens?
The 3 most popular Ethereum based wallets are Metamask, MyEtherWallet, and MyCrypto. However there are many other options available as well such as Argent, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet.
Ethereum 2.0 (The Merge)
Ethereum 2.0 is an upgrade that aims to solve the blockchain trilemma - security, scalability, and decentralization. In alternative smart contract platforms, they are designed to be highly scalable but compromises on decentralization. Whereas a highly secured and decentralized blockchain network would have the trade off being highly unscalable. Ethereum 2.0 brings a very different flavor of design that aims to addresses those issues by way of using Proof-of-Stake (POS), Beacon Chain, Sharding, and Execution Environment. Due to the complexity of the project, the developement will take place in 3 phases. A Proof-of-Stake Beacon Chain have been deployed and users are staking their ETH as a sign of confidence of the upcoming network. Research and development are still in progress to roll out the remaining phases.

2,tether,"What is Tether?
Tether is a stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another fiat currency like the US Dollar or to a commodity like Gold. 
Tether is the first stablecoin to be created and it is the most popular stablecoin used in the ecosystem. It has the largest stablecoins by circulation and market capitalization. 

Who created Tether?
Tether is controlled by Tether Holding Limited or known as Tether Limited. The CEO is JL Van Der Velde, the CFO is Giancarlo Devasini and the general counsel is Suart Hoegner. 
Tether was launched by the team running Bitfinex, a major cryptocurrency exchange.
How does it work?
Tether was originally based on the Omni Layer, a transport protocol on the Bitcoin blockchain. Therefore, the original version of Tether is characterized by the inherent stability and security of the longest established blockchain network.
To accelerate adoption, in September 2017, Tether was launched on the Ethereum blockchain, as an ERC20 token. Tether’s Ethereum ERC-20 is now the most popular Tether token type. 
Tether is now available on Ethereum, Tron, EOS, Liquid, and Algorand. You can see the full breakdown on Tether’s Transparency page. 
On 20th March 2020, Tether announced that they will also be on the Bitcoin Cash network via the Simple Ledger Protocol.
How does Tether maintain a 1:1 USD peg?
The USDT peg is maintained via a one-to-one collateral ratio. Tether Limited claims that every USDT in circulation is 100% backed by actual fiat in their reserves. Tether published their balances in their Transparency page. Tether Limited acts as a third-party custodian for the fiat currencies backing USDT. 
To understand the process of how Tether is controlled by Tether Limited, take a look at the flow of fund process below:
Step 1:­ User deposits fiat currency into Tether Limited's bank account. 
Step 2:­ Tether Limited generates and credits the user's Tether account. Tether enters into circulation. Amount of fiat currency deposited by the user must be equal to the amount of Tether issued to the user (E.g.: 500 USD deposited = 500 USDT issued)
Step 3­: User transacts with USDT. The user can transfer, exchange, and store USDT.
Step 4:­ The user deposits USDT with Tether Limited for redemption into fiat currency. 
Step 5:­ Tether Limited destroys the Tether and sends fiat currency to the user’s bank account. 
Users can also obtain Tether outside of the aforementioned process via an exchange or another individual. 
What is the purpose of Tether?

 
 Stable Currency
 Tether converts fiat US Dollar into blockchain stablecoins and expedites the transaction to other cryptocurrencies compared to using regular fiat currencies. 
 
 
 Wide Acceptance
 Tether acts as an alternative for deposit/withdrawal and has become a popular trading pair across major exchanges as it provides ease of use in calculating profit and loss for traders. The wide acceptance of Tether makes it convenient for users to move their USD holdings seamlessly between their wallets and exchanges.

What is Binance Coin (BNB)?
Binance Coin (BNB) is an exchange-based token created and issued by the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Initially created on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token in July 2017, BNB was migrated over to Binance Chain in February 2019 and became the native coin of the Binance Chain.
Binance Coin has seen massive growth in interest throughout the years. Several rounds of token burn events have appreciated BNB price and pushed it up as one of the top-10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. BNB can be traded in over 300 trading pairs across 120 exchanges tracked. 
What is Binance?
Binance is the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Changpeng Zhao and He Yi in July 2017. Binance started with an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and has since grown into one of the largest global cryptocurrency exchanges, both in terms of volume traded and market share by web traffic.
The Binance exchange is separated into the Spot market, Futures market, as well as the decentralized exchange, Binance DEX.
What can you use BNB for?
BNB was initially created as part of the Binance exchange through its ICO. In its whitepaper, Binance states that BNB was designed to be used to pay discounted fees on the Binance platform and also function as the native token powering the Binance Chain.
In addition to the initial use cases, BNB has added other cases both on and outside of the Binance platforms. Here’s an overview of BNB use cases:

 
 Reduced Trading Fees - When trading fees on Binance are paid using BNB, users are entitled to a 25% discount in fees.
 
 
 Binance Account Tier - Users with account balances in BNB and 30 days accumulated trading volume above certain thresholds are given VIP tiers with additional fee discounts and perks.
 
 
 Dust Conversion - Users can convert non-tradeable amounts of various cryptocurrencies called dust in their Binance account into BNB. 
 
 
 IEO Lottery - Binance’s Initial Exchange Offerings (IEO) are conducted using lottery allocations determined using the amount of BNB held by users. 
 
 
 Binance Chain Native Token - Much like how Ether (ETH) is used to pay for fees on the Ethereum Blockchain, BNB is used to pay for fees on the Binance Chain. BNB is needed to trade on the Binance DEX.
 
 
 Spent as Cryptocurrency - In addition to being used on Binance’s platforms, BNB can also be spent for payments in various ways, such as paying for travels, credit card fees, gifts and more. The full list is available here.

There may be more ways to use BNB that have not been covered here, but generally BNB can be used like any other cryptocurrencies to pay for goods and services as long as the merchant accepts it.
Binance Coin (BNB) Burn
Binance Coin (BNB) is designed with token burn in mind to induce scarcity and drive up the value of the token. In its v1.1 whitepaper (archived copy), Binance stated that 20% of Binance’s profits will be used to purchase BNB and subsequently destroyed in every quarter. In 2019, Binance updated its whitepaper to v1.2. In the updated whitepaper, it is stated that BNB burns will now be based on its exchanges’ trading volume.
Since Binance began burning BNB in Oct 2017, 10 rounds of token burns have taken place, with about 16.7 million BNB worth approximately $208 million burned up till January 2020.
Holding and Storing Binance Coin (BNB)
Binance Coin (BNB) is supported by various hardware and software wallet providers. The choice between hardware and software wallets is mostly a balancing act between convenience and security to the user. We’ll provide a quick rundown on them in this section.
Generally, hardware wallets (e.g. Ledger) are non-custodial wallets which keep private keys of a wallet offline and only the owner knows it. This is arguably the safest option for storage as the user has full ownership of the coins, but is likely the least convenient as it requires the user to operate additional hardware to spend/use the cryptocurrency. 
Non-custodial software wallets (e.g. Trust Wallet, Atomic Wallet) is the next option in terms of safety compared to hardware wallets, although they are likely more convenient. The private keys are also owned by the user, but since the wallet is kept on an online device (eg. the phone), there is a higher risk of losing the funds as hackers can access devices which are connected to the internet.
Lastly, arguably the most convenient yet risky storage method would be storing funds on custodial wallets (eg. on a centralized exchange such as Binance) as users do not own the private keys to the funds. A hack on the storage location can potentially cause users to lose their funds, much like what happened during the infamous 2014 Mt. Gox hack which recorded a massive loss of 850,000 BTC, most of which are customer funds.
Check out the full list of wallets which supports BNB on Binance’s own updated list here.
Are there any Binance Coin (BNB) Derivatives?
Yes, if you are looking to enter a long or short BNB position, both perpetual swaps and futures are available for BNB. Perpetual swap trading pairs are available across several platforms, including on Binance’s very own derivative exchange, Binance Futures with the BNBUSDT perpetual swap pair. For those who are looking for BNB futures trading, only FTX offers it at the moment.
Check out the full list of derivative products or derivative exchanges listed on CoinGecko.

5,ripple,"What is Ripple?

Ripple is a privately-held fintech company that provides a global payment solution via its patented payment network called Ripple Network (also known as RippleNet). RippleNet is a payment network that is built on top of Ripple’s consensus ledger, called XRP Ledger (also known as XRPL). Ripple funded the development of the open-source XRP Ledger.
Unlike most cryptocurrencies out there that cater to peer-to-peer needs, Ripple was made to connect banks, payment providers and digital asset exchanges, enabling real-time settlement expeditions and lower transaction fees.
What is the XRP Ledger?
XRP Ledger (XRPL) is the open-source distributed ledger that is created by Ripple. The native cryptocurrency of the XRP Ledger is XRP.
Compared to Bitcoin (BTC) which uses a distributed blockchain whose transactions are processed and secured by proof-of-work mining, XRP transactions are processed by a network of trusted validators on the XRP Ledger. 
Ripple transactions are publicly recorded on its open-source distributed consensus ledger which has a similar data structure to a blockchain where the successive data block includes the hash of the previous block. However, its consensus mechanism is different from Bitcoin or Ethereum. It does not rely on Proof of Work (PoW) and therefore there is no mining involved with XRP. 
XRP instead relies on a consensus algorithm known as the Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm. The XRPL’s integrity is maintained by a group of trusted nodes. All transactions must be agreed by a supermajority of these trusted nodes for it to achieve consensus and be included in the XRP Ledger.
How does it reach a consensus if there is no mining?
XRPL uses a different set of rules called the Ripple Consensus Protocol Algorithm (RCPA). The RCPA defines how XRPL is managed by a network of independent Ripple validator nodes. Any Ripple transaction needs to be verified by at least 80% of the nodes on the network.
Anyone can become a validator. However, Ripple maintains a given set of validators that can be trusted. This trusted list of nodes is called the Unique Node List (UNL).
If Alice wants to send 1,000 Japanese Yen to her cousin Bob in India, Alice could send it to the participating financial institutions. The JPY will be converted to XRP and will be validated by the servers in the network. Bob could withdraw the money in Indian Rupee once validated. The remittance can be done within seconds.
 
What is the difference between XRP, XRP Ledger, Ripple, and Ripple Network?

 
 XRP is the native token and the ticker symbol of the XRP Ledger 
 
 
 XRP Ledger is the distributed consensus ledger 
 
 
 Ripple (formerly known as Ripple Labs) is the company behind Ripple Network 
 
 
 Ripple Network is a global network payment built on top of the XRP Ledger

Who created Ripple?
Ripple was first started in 2004 by Ryan Fugger, who developed the first version of Ripple, called RipplePay. n 2012, Fugger handed it to Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen, where they co-founded OpenCoin. In 2013, OpenCoin then rebranded to Ripple Labs Incorporated. In 2016, Ripple Labs rebranded to Ripple. Chris is currently the Executive Chairman of Ripple. 
Jed McCaleb was previously the founder of Mt. Gox, the first Bitcoin exchange. He had a falling out with the Ripple team and forked the Ripple codebase to start Stellar. He is currently the CTO of Stellar. 
Brad Garlinghouse is currently the CEO of Ripple.
What is the purpose of Ripple?
Mediator
There are many currencies that can't be converted directly to each other. For example, if you want to convert currency A to currency B, you will need to do a double conversion: Currency A to USD and USD to Currency B. In this case, USD is the mediator that acts as a global bridge that connects different fiat currencies from the originators to the beneficiaries. XRP holds the same role but it is much cheaper than USD. The cost of a transaction on the Ripple protocol is about 0.00001 XRP and currently, 1 XRP price is at ~$0.15, which would cost you next to nothing.
Fast remittance 
Compared with the traditional remittance market, it can take up to 48 hours to transfer your money internationally. However, the average transaction time using XRP is 4 seconds. 
Can Ripple create more XRP?
No. XRP has been pre-mined with a supply cap of 100 billion tokens. 
Is Ripple different from Bitcoin?

 
 The total supply of XRP is capped at 100 billion while the total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million.
 
 
 XRP’s average transaction speed is 4 seconds while Bitcoin’s transaction speed is 10 minutes.
 
 
 XRP Ledger could handle 1,500 transactions per second, which is 600 times faster than Bitcoin. Bitcoin can only handle an average of around 2.5 transactions per second.
 
 
 While XRP outperforms Bitcoin in terms of transactions per second, it has a different underlying consensus mechanism (trusted validators on XRP Ledger vs. distributed miners on Bitcoin) and therefore does not offer the same security that Bitcoin offers.
 
 XRP’s transaction fee is 0.00001 XRP (roughly $0.000001), while Bitcoin’s transaction fee is about $0.50-$1.00 per transaction.

6,cardano,"Cardano crypto is a decentralised platform that will allow complex programmable transfers of value in a secure and scalable fashion. It is one of the first blockchains to be built in the highly secure Haskell programming language. Cardano is developing a smart contract platform which seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed. It is the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach. The development team consists of a large global collective of expert engineers and researchers.
The Cardano project is different from other blockchain projects as it openly addresses the need for regulatory oversight whilst maintaining consumer privacy and protections through an innovative software architecture. The protocol features a layered blockchain software stack that is flexible, scalable, and is being developed with the most rigorous academic and commercial software standards in the industry.
Cardano will use a democratic governance system that allows the project to evolve over time, and fund itself sustainably through a visionary treasury system.
Read this article to learn about Cardano in detail.
Technological Innovation
Cardano is the first protocol to incorporate Ouroboros, the groundbreaking proof of stake algorithm. The IOHK team employed a “first-principles” approach, driven by peer-reviewed academic research to build Cardano from the ground up.
The result of this collaborative effort is the first cryptocurrency to be based in Haskell code, which focuses on industrial strength product that delivers the resilience necessary for mission-critical systems, in this case, securing investment.
Cardano’s multi-layer protocol performs advanced functions, and has a settlement layer that is elegantly linked to a control layer. The settlement layer will have a unit of account, while the control layer will run smart contracts and will be programmed to recognize identity, assisting compliance (and allowing blacklisting, for instance).
The protocol is geared towards protecting privacy rights of users, while also taking into account the needs of regulators. In doing so, Cardano is the first protocol to balance these requirements in a nuanced and effective way, pioneering a new approach for cryptocurrencies.
The system is also designed to allow upgrade through soft forks, enabling it to adapt to changing needs and evolve quickly, when required. A treasury system is also being installed that will ensure the sustainability of the protocol.
Cardano is built in the spirit of collaboration by being completely open source and patent-free. Engineered for efficiency and scalability, the Cardano ecosystem will develop into the most complete cryptocurrency ever constructed.
Conceptual Innovation
i. Privacy and regulation
The original Bitcoin blockchain was meant to be a way for individuals to transact directly and anonymously with each other outside the control of banks and governments. This guarantees privacy in financial dealings, a fundamental individual right, but full anonymity can be counterproductive. Today most blockchain projects look to further either the aims of privacy or of regulation. To be effective globally, we think our blockchain must ‘square the circle’ by finding the right mix of individual privacy protection and provision for regulatory control.
ii. Governance
Public, decentralized blockchain projects rely on crowd-based governance models. This allows for democratic control of the network by its participants, which is essential to building truly decentralised economies. However, if they are not carefully designed, such governance can go awry. Both the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities have experienced devastating schisms on the question of how to upgrade their networks – in Ethereum's case already causing a split. The Cardano blockchain has an airtight governance model that allow the community to democratically take clear and binding decisions.
iii. Funding
The Cardano blockchain has sophisticated maintenance and development needs and is able to adequately fund itself, both in terms of running costs and new investment.
What is the ADA token?
Every blockchain project has a token of value commonly referred to as a cryptocurrency. Ada is the cryptocurrency on the Cardano blockchain. With Ada, holders can send value between friends, pay for a good or service, deposit funds on an exchange, or enter an application. To perform a transfer on the settlement layer requires you own Ada, or acquire Ada through an exchange. It will also be the native token to be used in applications built on the computation layer.
Daedalus Wallet
Each cryptocurrency requires a “wallet” to store Ada. Typically this wallet is a software application that can be installed on any computer or smartphone. Daedalus is a highly engineered wallet with advanced security features that was developed by IOHK specifically for the Cardano blockchain and protects your assets with the most advanced cryptography. In the future, Daedalus will not only support Ada, but other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum Classic and many more.
What is the Cardano Foundation?
The Cardano Foundation’s core mission is to standardise, protect and promote the Cardano Protocol technology. The Cardano Foundation acts as a supervisory and educational body for Cardano. Our mission is to:
1. Standardise, protect and promote the Cardano Protocol and its applications

8,solana,"What is Solana (SOL)?
Solana crypto is a high throughput blockchain based on the Proof of History (PoH) and Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus. Built by a team of networking engineers, Solana aims to become the blockchain infrastucture for modern internet applications.
Who founded Solana?
Solana was founded by 4 co-founders, led by Anatoly Yakovenko.
Anatoly Yakovenko wrote and published a whitepaper on the concept of Proof of History in November 2017. Proof of History is a concept introduced to keep time between computers in a network in sync which forms the basis of scaling the number of transactions.
Greg Fitzgerald, whom used to be Anatoly's colleague at Qualcomm participated in the project by suggesting and writing the Proof of History codebase in the Rust programming language. 
Stephen Akridge and Raj Gokal joined the project shortly later and together the 4 individuals incorporated the new blockchain network called Solana in 2018.
What makes Solana unique?
Solana is a general purpose blockchain similar to Ethereum. It has a different technical underlying such that developers write applications using Rust instead of Solidity or Vyper. End user applications in the Solana ecosystem includes decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT), marketplaces, games, e-commerce and more.
One of its biggest feature is its scalability in which Solana is able to process over 700,000 transactions per second. Its high throughput capability appeals to high frequency traders, in which spearheaded by FTX and Alameda Research.
What is the SOL currency used for?
Solana's native currency is SOL. Solana (SOL) is used to pay for transaction fees and staking in order to support the network.
Solana in 2022
Solana crypto price experienced a hyperbolic growth in 2021. With the advent of multichain and increased adoption of DeFi and NFT, Solana managed to capture a large market share. Developers were attracted by the technical underlying and started building dapps such as Star Atlas, Mercurial, Orca, Saber, and more. Yield farming on Solana caught on shortly after that as a way to attract liquidity and activities to the network. In 2022, it remains to be seen if Solana and its ecosystem of dapps is able to capture market share.
While Solana has been on a high note, it did experienced some setback with network outages lasting as long as over 16 hours on September 15th, 2021. The Solana team and node operators coordinated a reset in order to revive the network. Despite that, Solana coin managed to remain steady above $150 after the incident occured.

9,polkadot,"Polkadot is a platform that allows diverse blockchains to transfer messages, including value, in a trust-free fashion; sharing their unique features while pooling their security. In brief, Polkadot is a scalable heterogeneous multi-chain technology.
Polkadot is heterogeneous because it is entirely flexible and makes no assumption about the nature or structure of the chains in the network. Even non-blockchain systems or data structures can become parachains if they fulfill a set of criteria. Watch this video to learn about Polkadot blockchain ecosystem.
Polkadot may be considered equivalent to a set of independent chains (e.g. a set containing Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Namecoin and Bitcoin) except with important additions: pooled security and trust-free interchain transactability.
Many of the native parachains of Polkadot will be written using a Polkadot Runtime Environment SDK (e.g. Parity Technologies' Substrate). Read this article to learn about Polkadot parachain auctions.

10,dogecoin,"What is Dogecoin (DOGE)?
Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that was created on December 6th, 2013 based on the popular ""Doge"" Internet meme and features a Shiba Inu on its logo.
The codebase of the project was a fork of Litecoin, in which most of the same features such hash hashing algorithm were inherited, with the only difference of branding and large inflationary supply.
Introduced as a ""joke currency"", Dogecoin quickly developed its own online community and reached a capitalization of US$60 million in January 2014. Compared with other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin had a fast initial coin production schedule: 100 billion coins were in circulation by mid-2015, with an additional 5.256 billion coins every year thereafter. As of 30 June 2015, the 100 billionth Dogecoin had been mined.
Dogecoin was created by Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon and  Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia. Both wanted to create a fun cryptocurrency that will appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience. Dogecoin is primarily used as a tipping system on Reddit and Twitter where users tip each other for creating or sharing good content. The community is very active in organising fundraising activities for deserving causes.
The developers of Dogecoin haven’t made any major changes to the coin since 2015. This means that Dogecoin could get left behind and is why Shibas are leaving Dogecoin to join more advanced platforms like Ethereum. One of Dogecoin strengths is its relaxed and fun-loving community. However, this is also a weakness because other currencies are way more professional.
Dogecoin in 2022
Fast forward today in 2022, Dogecoin has grown so much and have gathered the mainstream attention. It has become a meme that is used by the likes of Tesla billionaire, Elon Musk and even more so spunned off even more meme coins into the market.
Dogecoin followers have always been asking if Dogecoin would ever reach $1. It is hard to say where the price action will go, but high volatility seem to be mainstay as the utility of the cryptocurrency remains unclear being a meme coin.
Where to buy Dogecoin?
You may buy Dogecoin on centralized exchanges such as Binance, Crypto.com, Coinbase, Bitfinex, and more.

12,staked-ether,"Lido Staked Ether (stETH) is a token that represents your staked ether in Lido, combining the value of initial deposit and staking rewards. stETH tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed.
While the price of stETH to ETH is based on the market demand, stETH token balances are pegged 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido and the token’s balances are updated daily to reflect earnings and rewards. At this moment, stETH price can deviate from 1 ETH as it is currently not possible to claim the underlying ETH until Ethereum 2.0 fully merges. stETH tokens can be used as one would use ether, allowing you to earn ETH 2.0 staking rewards whilst benefiting from e.g. yields across decentralised finance products.
As of June 11, 2022, 1 stETH is worth 0.955 ETH due to liquidity issue and supposed additional risks due to the delay of the merge alongside with DAO/smart contract risks.

13,shiba-inu,"What is Shiba Inu (SHIB)?
Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme token which began as a fun currency and has now transformed into a decentralized ecosystem. During the initial launch, 50% of the supply was allocated into Vitalik Buterin's ethereum wallet. The price of SHIB has soared from as low as $0.000000000056 to an all time high of $0.000084, that is a 150,000 times increase within 8 months.
As a result of that, Vitalik proceeded to donate 10% of his SHIB holdings to a COVID-19 relief effort in India and the remaining 40% is burnt forever. That donation was worth about $1 billion at that time, which makes it one of the largest donation ever in the world.

What has the Shiba Inu community worked on?
The Shiba Inu team launched a decentralized exchange called Shibaswap with 2 new tokens, LEASH and BONE. LEASH is a scarce supply token that is used to offer incentives on Shibaswap. BONE is the governance token for holders to vote on proposals on Doggy DAO.
Shiba Inu coin in 2022
Right now in 2022, Shiba Inu coin has captured mainstream attention as a meme coin. On Oct 28th, 2021, the cryptocurrency reached an all-time-high price of $0.000084. That was a +150,000,000% increase from when it was launched in August 2020.
Looking at the overall chart, Shiba Inu grew at a faster rate and have overtaken Dogecoin in terms of market cap. Both are running the narrative as the dominant global meme coin and a very volatile as there are no utility other than speculation and for transaction purposes.
The rapid rise of Shiba Inu coin price have gotten a lot of crypto analysts and experts concern about an incoming massive correction.

14,matic-network,"Polygon (Previously Matic Network) is the first well-structured, easy-to-use platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development. Its core component is Polygon SDK, a modular, flexible framework that supports building multiple types of applications.
Using Polygon, one can create Optimistic Rollup chains, ZK Rollup chains, stand alone chains or any other kind of infra required by the developer. 
Polygon effectively transforms Ethereum into a full-fledged multi-chain system (aka Internet of Blockchains). This multi-chain system is akin to other ones such as Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche etc with the advantages of Ethereum’s security, vibrant ecosystem and openness.
Nothing will change for the existing ecosystem built on the Plasma-POS chain. With Polygon, new features are being built around the existing proven technology to expand the ability to cater to diverse needs from the developer ecosystem. Polygon will continue to develop the core technology so that it can scale to a larger ecosystem.

15,dai,"What is Dai?

Dai is the native stablecoin for the Maker protocol. It is the world’s first crypto-collateralized and decentralized stablecoin, whose value is soft pegged to the US Dollar. The collateralized assets backing Dai are other cryptocurrencies instead of fiat and are held within smart contracts rather than in institutions.
 
What is Maker?
Maker is a smart contract lending platform that enables users to take out loans by locking-in collateral in exchange for Dai. It was founded by the Maker Foundation in 2015 as an open-source project to offer economic freedom and opportunities to anyone, anywhere. In 2017, it launched  the Maker governance token (MKR) and its first stablecoin iteration known as the Single Collateral Dai (SAI), which used Ether (ETH) as collateral. 
Two years later in 2019, the Foundation released the Multi-Collateral Dai (DAI), phasing out SAI. The platform has enjoyed widespread adoption and is the largest decentralized lending platform with around $2.58 billion in total value locked (TVL), as of December 2020.
What can Dai (DAI) do? Dai has several strong benefits and use cases. Most notably, Dai’s soft peg to the US Dollar helps mitigate price volatility. In the cryptocurrency space where price swings are common and dramatic, this feature helps preserve Dai’s value and promotes its use as a medium of exchange. 
Additionally, the stablecoin’s decentralized nature means that it is highly composable with other decentralized applications (Dapps) such as Compound, Uniswap etc. It also provides greater transparency and censorship resistance compared to centralized solutions. 
The source code for the protocol can be viewed freely by anyone who wishes to do so. Dai holders can also save their Dai and earn interest through the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) mechanism. Further reading on Dai’s benefits and use cases can be found in Maker’s whitepaper and ecosystem page. 
Where and how do I obtain Dai?
There are two main methods to obtaining Dai: i) buying it from an exchange and ii) opening a Maker Vault. For the first method, users can head to an exchange such as Coinbase. You can find Dai trading on various centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges via the link provided. This page's market tab also shows a list of all the exchanges that are trading Dai pairs.
The second method involves locking-in collateral in the Maker protocol’s smart contracts known as Maker Vaults. To get started, users should head over to Oasis, connect their wallet, and follow the relevant instructions. 
The amount of Dai minted will depend on two factors: i) the amount of collateral locked-in and ii) the chosen collateral’s collateralization ratio. For instance, if a user chooses Ether (ETH) as collateral and the collateralization ratio of ETH is 150%, then the user would need to lock-in 1.5 ETH for every 1 Dai he/she mints. 
Obtaining Dai in this manner thus incurs debt and an interest fee known as the Stability Fee. Importantly, should a Maker Vault owner fail to maintain his/her collateralization ratio, the vault may be liquidated, and a liquidation penalty imposed. More information on how to open a Maker Vault, as well as on Stability Fees can be found here.
What cryptocurrencies can I use as collateral?
Maker provides a list of cryptocurrency assets that can be used as collateral on Oasis’ borrow tab. As of December 2020, there are 16 supported assets, each with their own differing collateralization ratios and stability fees. The addition of new collateral assets, as well as the determination of collateralization ratios and stability fees are decided through voting on Maker’s governance platform. 
How does Dai work?
In principle, Dai is similar to a loan or mortgage. In traditional finance, these credit facilities are obtained from financial institutions upon fulfilling several stringent requirements such as the provision of sufficient collateral, robust credit scores and compliance with KYC and criminal background checks. The key differences with Dai however, is that only collateral in the form of cryptocurrencies is needed, and Dai loans are issued in a decentralized manner via smart contracts. 
The stablecoin’s soft peg to the US Dollar is also another distinguishing feature, maintained through supply and demand auctions, the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) and Stability Fees. For instance, if Dai >$1, users would be incentivized to mint more Dai and lock-in additional collateral. The minting of more Dai will increase its supply and thus, bring Dai’s value back to its target price. 
The DSR and Stability Fees can also be altered to incentivize less/more Dai given if prices remain sticky. The inner workings of Dai’s soft peg can be read on its auction documentation here, as well as briefly in the whitepaper.

16,tron,"What is Tron (TRX)?
Tron is a blockchain-based decentralized operating system much like Ethereum that aims to advance the decentralization of the Internet and its infrastructure. At its core, Tron is a smart contract platform that offers high throughput, high scalability, and high availability for all Decentralized Applications (DApps) in the TRON ecosystem. The Tron blockchain is built around the usability of its native token, Tronix (TRX).

Who created Tron?
The Tron blockchain was created by Tron Foundation, a Singapore based organization that is currently headed by Justin Sun. Prior to creating the Tron Foundation, Sun founded Peiwo, an app that aspires to be the Asian Snapchat. This app got Sun into the 2017 Forbes 30 under 30 list. 
Sun was also the former Chief Representative of Ripple in China and a graduate of Hupan University.
Tron came about after a successful ICO which raised over $70 million in September 2017.
What is the Value of Tron?
Using the blockchain and its decentralized smart contract capability, the idea of Tron is that users will experience a decentralized internet where “middlemen” such as Google and Facebook are not needed for users to access content.
To draw an example, currently the most ubiquitous video sharing platform is Youtube, which is a privately owned company with privately owned servers that stores and serves video to its viewers. However, using Youtube’s services means that creators and users have to comply with Youtube's terms of service and may have to pay for its content in one way or another. Creators on the Youtube platform may earn a share of Youtube’s revenue, but the pay structure is entirely up to Youtube’s discretion. 
Tron aims to replace services such as Youtube and others by becoming the decentralized infrastructure in which users can connect directly with creators and pay the creators directly for the content they wish to consume.
How does the Tron Blockchain work?
The TRON protocol runs on a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) Governance Model. This allows users to perform transactions with close to zero-fee whilst still being resistant towards transaction spam. 
Transactions on the Tron Blockchain are maintained by a consortium of Super Representatives (SR) that are voted in by TRX holders who have locked their stake in the form of Tron Power. There are 27 top-voted Super Representatives and 100 Super Representative Candidates. The hierarchy of SR and SR Candidates are readjusted every 6 hours based on the number of votes they receive from Tron Power holders.
Can I mine Tron?
No, you can’t mine Tron because Tron runs on a Delegated Proof of Stake consensus algorithm. This is different from Bitcoin which uses the Proof of Work algorithm. New Tron tokens are created as block rewards for elected Super Representatives. This serves as an incentive to the Super Representatives in maintaining the integrity of the Tron network. You can participate by staking your TRX and voting for your desired Super Representative.
What can I do on Tron?
At its core, Tron is a smart contract platform. Specifically, it is built to be Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible, meaning it has a Turing complete virtual machine capability. Executing smart contracts on Tron is similar to Ethereum. 
On the other hand, whilst Ethereum operates on the gas fee transaction model, Tron operates on the Bandwidth model, which is similar to that of EOS. This is how transactions on Tron can be much cheaper and more seamless than Ethereum.
Just as one can issue smart contract tokens such as ERC-20, ERC-1155 and others on Ethereum, it is also possible to issue smart contract tokens on the Tron too. There are currently 2 token standards possible on Tron, namely TRC10 and TRC20. 
Various TRC10 and TRC20 tokens have been issued on Tron with various use cases.
What can I use TRX for?
There are numerous Decentralized Appliactions (Dapps) built on the Tron Blockchain, many of which require the use of the native Tronix (TRX) token. You can easily swap your TRX for TRC10 tokens which are used by many Dapps on the Tron Blockchain such as BitTorrent, 888Tron and others.
How to store TRX?
The Tron Foundation has made it very easy for users to store and utilize TRX in their day-to-day online activities. The Foundation recommends TronLink and TronWallet as their official community developed wallet. You can also store and use your TRX in most other widely recognized wallet brands such as Trust Wallet, Ledger, Cobo Wallet and others.
Where can I trade TRX?
You can see the full list of exchanges trading TRX right here on this page. CoinGecko continually tracks the latest market movement of TRX and provides this data for you.
Can I trade TRX Derivatives?
Yes, there are various Tron derivative and futures markets. Some examples include the TRXH20 and TRXM20 futures contract on BitMex. Check out the full list of derivative products or derivative exchanges.

What is Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)?

Wrapped Bitcoin is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain that represents Bitcoin. Each WBTC is backed 1:1 with Bitcoin. Wrapped Bitcoin allows for Bitcoin transfers to be conducted quicker on the Ethereum blockchain and opens up the possibility for BTC to be used in the Ethereum ecosystem. 
Bitcoin is held in custody by the centralized custodian, BitGo. Bitcoin can be converted to Wrapped Bitcoin and vice versa easily.
How was Wrapped Bitcoin founded?
WBTC was launched in January 2019. BitGo, Kyber Network and Ren collaborated to find a way for users to bring more liquidity into the Ethereum ecosystem and that’s how Wrapped Bitcoin was created. 
What problem does WBTC solve?
Most Decentralized Finance (DeFi) activities take place on the Ethereum blockchain and Bitcoin holders have no access to a wide selection of DeFi applications which includes features like lending, borrowing, trading and more. 
WBTC helps transfer the value of Bitcoin into the Ethereum blockchain so that users could start generating higher returns with their Bitcoin.
Who are the key players in the WBTC ecosystem? 
There are a few key players in the WBTC ecosystem. They are: 

 
 Custodian - Custodians are institutions that store crypto assets. In the case of WBTC, BitGo is responsible for custodying Bitcoin
 
 
 Merchant - Merchants play a key role in the distribution of WTBC by minting or burning WBTC
 
 
 Users - Users are holders of WBTC. Users can use WBTC to transfer and transact like any other ERC20 token in the Ethereum ecosystem
 
 
 WBTC DAO Member - WBTC DAO is the governing body that is responsible for contract changes and the addition/removal of custodian and merchant. This governance body helps decentralize the network via multisig contracts which requires all members to reach consensus before initiating a change.

How to convert BTC to WBTC?


 
 To convert BTC to WBTC, a user may visit any of the platforms that is labeled “Merchant” in the WBTC partners page.
 
 
 The user is required to verify his identity through a Know Your Customer (KYC) procedure. 
 
 
 After that, the user is required to transfer his BTC to the merchant’s BTC wallet.
 
 
 Once the merchant receives the BTC, the merchant will then notify the custodian, BitGo, the amount of WBTC to be minted.
 
 
 After obtaining 6 confirmations of the BTC transaction, the custodian will then produce an equivalent amount of WBTC.
 
 
 Finally, the WBTC will be sent to the user’s Ethereum wallet.

 After 25 Ethereum block confirmations, the custodian will release an equivalent amount of BTC to the merchant’s Bitcoin address.
 
 
 Custodian makes an Ethereum transaction marking the burn request as completed.
 
 
 The user undergoes KYC procedure to redeem BTC.
 
 
 After that is done, the merchant will send BTC to the user’s BTC wallet address.

How to keep track of WBTC? 

The conversion between WBTC and BTC is completed in a transparent manner. Users may refer to WBTC’s orderbook dashboard to see a record of all minting and burning of WBTC on the Ethereum network. 
Also, users can access WBTC’s proof of assets dashboard to view the transaction amount and the total amount of BTC held under custody. This system makes it easy for audits on a regular basis and it is a good method to maintain the trust of its users.
What is the risk of using WBTC?
Some of the biggest concerns of using WBTC is centralization and trust. All of the BTC backing WBTC are stored at BitGo, a centralized entity. BitGo is viewed as a central point of failure because it’s the only custodian overseeing WBTC at the moment. Also, users have to completely trust BitGo to safely store their BTC and honor the users’ redemption requests. 
It is important to note that BitGo is one of the most reputable centralized custodian in the world and they have one of the most advanced coin security protocols in place. Not to forget, they are covered by digital asset insurance worth up to $100 million if anything bad were to occur.
What are other ways to acquire WBTC?
If users choose not to mint for WBTC, they can purchase WBTC in the Ethereum blockchain like any ERC-20 token through decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap or SushiSwap.

22,litecoin,"What is Litecoin (LTC)?
Litecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency created by Charlie Lee. It was created based on the Bitcoin protocol but differs in terms of the hashing algorithm used. Litecoin uses the memory intensive Scrypt proof of work mining algorithm. Scrypt allows consumer-grade hardware such as GPU to mine those coins.
Why Litecoin?
Litecoin is a cryptocurrency that has evolved from Bitcoin after its own popularity in the industry, this alternative, or ‘altcoin’ has emerged to allow investors to diversify their digital currency package, according to Investopedia. Litecoin is one of the most prominent altcoins and was created by former Google employee and Director of Engineering at Coinbase, Charlie Lee. Litecoin was the first to alter Bitcoin and the most significant difference is that it takes 2.5 minutes for Litecoin to generate a block, or transaction, in comparison to Bitcoin's 10 minutes.
‘While this matters little to traders, miners who use hardware to run Bitcoin's network cannot switch over to Litecoin. This keeps bigger mining conglomerates away from Litecoin because they cannot easily optimize their profits by swapping to another coin, contributing to a more decentralized experience. Litecoin also has bigger blocks, and more coins in circulation, making it more affordable and swift when transacting,’ Investopedia explained.
As explained above, Litecoin can transact a lot faster than Bitcoin, but there are also a number of other characteristics that investors need to know before trading. Litecoin can handle higher volumes of transactions because of the capability of transacting faster and if Bitcoin attempted to transact on the scale of its altcoin, a code update would be needed. However, Litecoin’s blocks would be larger, but with more ‘orphaned blocks'. The faster block time of litecoin reduces the risk of double spending attacks - this is theoretical in the case of both networks having the same hashing power.
Litecoin Technical Details:
The transaction confirmation time taken for Litecoin is about 2.5 minutes on average (as compared to Bitcoin's 10 minutes). The Litecoin network is scheduled to cap at 84 million currency units. 
Litecoin has inspired many other popular alternative currencies (eg. Dogecoin) because of its Scrypt hashing algorithm in order to prevent ASIC miners from mining those coins. However it is said that by the end of this year, Scrypt ASIC will enter the mass market.
Litecoin in 2022 and beyond
Litecoin was launched in 2011. Over the last 11 years trading in the market, it has been underperforming against bitcoin in terms of price despite it being the silver to bitcoin's gold. This is most likely due to the proliferation of newer alternative cryptocurrencies with new utility such as smart contract, DeFi, GameFi, governance and more. Litecoin tends to hold value quite well and experience lower volatility as a mature cryptocurrency, especially when compared to meme coins.
Market watchers are observing what will the price of Litecoin be in 2025. Based on historical performance, Litecoin tracks the overall cryptocurrency market. As bitcoin price and the overall crypto market cap goes up, Litecoin tends to follow accordingly.

What is Chainlink?
Chainlink is a framework for building Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs) that bring real-world data onto blockchain networks, enabling the creation of hybrid smart contracts. These DONs provide decentralized services such as Price Feeds, Proof of Reserve, Verifiable Randomness, Keepers, and the ability to connect to any web API. 
It aims to ensure that the external information (pricing, weather data, event outcomes, etc.) and off-chain computations (randomness, transaction automation, fair ordering, etc.) fed to on-chain smart contracts are reliable and tamper-proof.

Chainlink oracle networks are blockchain-agnostic and are incentivized through the native LINK token, used for node payments and network collateral. 
Watch a video to learn about Chainlink.
A brief history of Chainlink
Chainlink is an open-source protocol developed by Chainlink Labs (formerly Smart Contract Ltd.), founded in 2014 by Sergey Nazarov and Steve Ellis. 
The Chainlink Network went live on the Ethereum mainnet on June 1st, 2019 and has since expanded to support additional blockchains and layer 2 networks such as Polygon, BSC, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and more.
What is the purpose of Chainlink?
To understand the purpose and function of Chainlink, we will split it into two sections:

 The Chainlink Network
 The Chainlink (LINK) token

The Chainlink Network
Before we dive into the function of the Chainlink Network, we need to understand the basics of smart contracts and how oracles work. 
Smart contracts are programmatic code (if x event occurs, execute y action) that operate on a blockchain network. However, due to the security model of blockchain networks, smart contracts are isolated from the external world and cannot natively connect to off-chain systems. 
To overcome this problem, an additional piece of infrastructure is required known as an “oracle” which relays data from the real world onto blockchain networks, where it can be consumed by smart contracts. 
The Chainlink Network addresses this issue through Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs) that consist of a network of independent oracle node operators that fetch, aggregate, validate, and deliver real-world data on-chain. Each oracle node can specialize in providing different decentralized services on the behalf of smart contracts.
Chainlink DONs support two different ways of delivering off-chain data to on-chain smart contracts. This includes the basic request model and the decentralized data model. 

 Basic Request Model: Smart contracts generate and submit a data request to Chainlink oracle nodes in one transaction and receive the response later in time within a separate transaction.
 Decentralized Data Model: A shared data resource where Chainlink oracle nodes regularly update an on-chain reference contract with fresh data, allowing smart contracts to query and receive real-world data in a single transaction. 

The decentralized data model is powered by Chainlink nodes using the Off-Chain Reporting Protocol (OCR), where data is fetched and aggregated off-chain, before a single transaction is submitted on-chain containing each node’s signature and corresponding data point. 
The Chainlink Token (LINK)
LINK is an ERC-677 token that is used to incentivize the proper operation of Chainlink DONs. The token has also been bridged across multiple blockchains to enable native Chainlink oracle integrations.
The LINK token is used within the Chainlink Network for the following components: 

 Node Operators Fees: Smart contracts are required to pay Chainlink nodes using LINK tokens to obtain access to real-world data and other oracle services. 
 Implicit Staking: The current and future revenue of Chainlink nodes are denominated in LINK tokens, incentivizing the proper operation of the Chainlink Network.
 Explicit Staking: Chainlink nodes in the future can be required to lock up LINK tokens as collateral to back their oracle services, which can be slashed for malicious behavior. 

Who uses Chainlink?
The Chainlink Network is used by smart contract applications that require access to real-world data and off-chain computations. The network is also used by data providers to monetize their datasets by selling their APIs to smart contract applications.
The most common use case includes securing Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols which require financial market data. The Chainlink Network offers a variety of on-chain data feeds that are used to secure tens of billions of dollars. Integrated applications include Aave, Compound, Synthetix, and more.

25,uniswap,"
What is UNI?
UNI is the governance token for Uniswap. UNI was introduced on 16th September 2020 through a retrospective airdrop to users who have interacted with the protocol either by swapping tokens or by providing liquidity.
The UNI token allows token holders to participate in the governance of the protocol. Key decisions such as usage of the treasury or future upgrades can be decided through a governance vote.
What is Uniswap?
Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that makes it easy for users to swap an ERC-20 token for another ERC-20 token without the need of a centralized intermediary. With a DEX, traders do not have to deposit their tokens on an exchange and be exposed to the security risks of a centralized exchange. 
Users just need an Ethereum wallet like Metamask and they can immediately start swapping tokens. Users can then swap tokens directly without the need of an orderbook. This works using an Automated Market Maker (AMM) where Liquidity Providers (LP) deposit tokens into the smart contract and this liquidity then provides a price quote to traders without relying on any professional market makers. Liquidity Providers are compensated with a 0.3% trading fee for providing liquidity on the protocol.

When was Uniswap founded?
The protocol was founded by Hayden Adams in 2018. Hayden was mainly inspired by the technology that was first described by Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin.
What is an Automated Market Maker (AMM)?
An AMM uses a pricing algorithm to price assets. Uniswap uses the “x*y = k” formula to price its assets. Within the formula, x represents the amount of one token in the liquidity pool, y is the amount of the other asset and k is a fixed constant. In Uniswap, the value of both assets constantly remains at a ratio of 50:50.
Uniswap popularized the AMM model and other crypto protocols started utilizing the AMM due to its innovative and decentralized features. However, one of the biggest setbacks for the AMM model is impermanent loss.
Impermanent loss is the opportunity cost of contributing two crypto assets into a liquidity pool instead of holding the two crypto assets separately outside the liquidity pool. Impermanent loss occurs when the price of one token rises or falls relative to the other. The larger the change, the larger the impermanent loss will be.
How to obtain UNI?
UNI tokens are available for purchase in a few decentralized and centralized exchanges. In the past, one way to obtain free UNI would be through liquidity mining but the incentive ended on 17th November 2020. There are currently no known ways of obtaining free UNI tokens, hence any kind of airdrop promoted online would most likely be a scam.
What is UNI’s Price Prediction
Currently, the 0.3% trading fees do not accrue to UNI token holders - all trading fees currently only accrue to Liquidity Providers. With the protocol doing over $1 billion of daily trading volume, experts are speculating that the price of UNI will be based on the potential return made through fees, should at some point governance decide to enable that.

"
27,cosmos,"What is Cosmos Hub (ATOM)?
The Cosmos network consists of many independent, parallel blockchains, called zones, each powered by classical Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols like Tendermint (already used by platforms like ErisDB). Some zones act as hubs with respect to other zones, allowing many zones to interoperate through a shared hub.
The architecture is a more general application of the Bitcoin sidechains concept, using classic BFT and Proof-of-Stake algorithms, instead of Proof-of-Work.Cosmos can interoperate with multiple other applications and cryptocurrencies, something other blockchains can’t do well. By creating a new zone, you can plug any blockchain system into the Cosmos hub and pass tokens back and forth between those zones, without the need for an intermediary.
While the Cosmos Hub is a multi-asset distributed ledger, there is a special native token called the atom. Atoms have three use cases: as a spam-prevention mechanism, as staking tokens, and as a voting mechanism in governance.
As a spam prevention mechanism, Atoms are used to pay fees. The fee may be proportional to the amount of computation required by the transaction, similar to Ethereum’s concept of “gas”. Fee distribution is done in-protocol and a protocol specification is described here.
As staking tokens, Atoms can be “bonded” in order to earn block rewards. The economic security of the Cosmos Hub is a function of the amount of Atoms staked. The more Atoms that are collateralized, the more “skin” there is at stake and the higher the cost of attacking the network. Thus, the more Atoms there are bonded, the greater the economic security of the network.
Atom holders may govern the Cosmos Hub by voting on proposals with their staked Atoms.

28,stellar,"The Stellar network is an open source, distributed, and community owned network used to facilitate cross-asset transfers of value. Stellar aims to help facilitate cross-asset transfer of value at a fraction of a penny while aiming to be an open financial system that gives people of all income levels access to low-cost financial services. Stellar can handle exchanges between fiat-based currencies and between cryptocurrencies. Stellar.org, the organization that supports Stellar, is centralized like XRP and meant to handle cross platform transactions and micro transactions like XRP. However, unlike Ripple, Stellar.org is non-profit and their platform itself is open source and decentralized. 
Stellar was founded by Jed McCaleb in 2014. Jed McCaleb is also the founder of Mt. Gox and co-founder of Ripple, launched the network system Stellar with former lawyer Joyce Kim. Stellar is also a payment technology that aims to connect financial institutions and drastically reduce the cost and time required for cross-border transfers. In fact, both payment networks used the same protocol initially.
Distributed Exchange
Through the use of its intermediary currency Lumens (XLM), a user can send any currency that they own to anyone else in a different currency.
For instance, if Joe wanted to send USD to Mary using her EUR, an offer is submitted to the distributed exchange selling USD for EUR. This submitted offer forms is known as an order book. The network will use the order book to find the best exchange rate for the transaction in-order to minimize the fee paid by a user.
This multi-currency transaction is possible because of ""Anchors"". Anchors are trusted entities that hold people’s deposits and can issue credit. In essence, Anchors serves as the bridge between different currencies and the Stellar network.
Lumens (XLM)
Lumens are the native asset (digital currency) that exist on the Stellar network that helps to facilitate multi-currency transactions and prevent spams. For multi-currency transactions, XLM is the digital intermediary that allows for such a transaction to occur at a low cost.
In-order to prevent DoS attacks (aka spams) that would inevitably occur on the Stellar network, a small fee of 0.00001 XLM is associated with every transaction that occurs on the network. This fee is small enough so it does not significantly affect the cost of transaction, but large enough so it dissuades bad actors from spamming the network. 
Prior to Protocol 12, Stellar had a built-in inflation mechanism conceived to allow account holders to collectively direct inflation-generated lumens toward projects built on Stellar.
As the network evolved and grew, it became increasingly clear that inflation wasn’t working as intended — account holders either didn’t set their inflation destination or joined inflation pools to claim the inflation themselves, and the operational costs associated with inflation payments continued to rise — and so a protocol change to disable inflation was proposed, implemented, voted on by validators, and ultimately adopted as part of a network upgrade.
The inflation operation is now deprecated.

30,monero,"What is Monero (XMR)?
Monero (XMR) is the top privacy-centric cryptocurrency based on the CryptoNote protocol, a secure, private and untraceable currency system. Monero uses a special kind of cryptography to ensure that all of its transactions are  remain 100% unlinkable and untraceable. In an increasingly transparent world, you can see why something like Monero can become so desirable.
Origins of Monero (XMR)
In July of 2012, Bytecoin, the first real life implementation of CryptoNote, was launched. While Bytecoin had promise, people noticed that 80% of the coins were already published. So, it was decided that the bytecoin blockchain will be forked and the new coins in the new chain will be called Bitmonero, which is was then renamed Monero, meaning “coin” in Esperanto language. In this new blockchain, a block will be mined and added every two minutes.
Why Monero (XMR)?
#1: Unlinkability - Your identity is completely private You have complete control over your transactions. You are responsible for your money. Because your identity is private no one will be able to see what you are spending your money on. When you send funds to someone’s public address, what happens is that you actually send the funds to a randomly created brand new one-time destination address.  This means that the public record does not contain any mention that funds were received to the recipient’s public address. In Monero, your public address will never appear in the public record of transactions. Instead, a 'stealth address' is recorded in a way that only you, the recipient, can recognize the incoming funds.
#2: Fungibility Fungibility is interchangeability between one asset and another asset of the same type. Suppose you borrowed $50 from your friend, you can even return the money in the form of 1 $50 bill or 5 $10 bill, It is still fine. This shows that the dollar has fungible properties. However, if you were to borrow someone’s car for the weekend and come back and give them some other car in return, then that person will probably punch on the face. Cars, in this example, are a nonfungible asset.
What is CryptoNote?
CryptoNote is the application layer protocol that fuels various decentralized currencies. While it is similar to the application layer which runs bitcoin in many aspects, there a lot of areas where the two differ from each other. CryptoNote features an entirely new code base and is not a fork of Bitcoin. More info about CryptoNote can be found at their website. 
CryptoNote uses Ring Signatures to conceal sender identities via mixing and it also has unlinkable transactions that is achieved using 1-time keys for each individual payments. Ring signatures enable ‘transaction mixing’ to occur. Transaction mixing means that when funds are sent, the sender randomly chooses several other users’ funds to also appear in the transaction as a possible source of the funds being sent. 
The cryptographical nature of the ring signature means that no one can tell which of the funds were really the source of the transaction – not even the person that gave the funds to the sender in the first place. A system of ‘key images’ associated with each ring signature ensures that although no one can tell the true source of the funds, it can be easily detected if the sender attempts to anonymously send their funds twice.

31,bitcoin-cash," 

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a form of cryptocurrency much like Bitcoin. In fact, Bitcoin Cash was a fork of Bitcoin as a result of a chain split when a certain group of Bitcoin developers became dissatisfied with Bitcoin’s overall scalability direction.
In November 2018, the Bitcoin Cash community would later further split into Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV via another hard fork. The latter camp, supported by Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre proposed a competing software version called Bitcoin Satoshi Vision that would take the block size limit further to 128MB.
On November 15th, 2020 the Bitcoin Cash experienced another hard fork. The forked occured on block #661647 have led to the launch of Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCHA). The Bitcoin Cash ABC network includes a miners' tax where 8% of the mining rewards will be distributed to the BCHA developers as financing for protocol development.
To sum it up simply, the Bitcoin Cash developers were originally dissatisfied with the decisions made in regards to Bitcoin’s development. Specifically, they were dissatisfied over the implementation of Segregated Witness (SegWit). The Bitcoin Cash developers believe that SegWit is a compromise to the decentralization of the Bitcoin network. They believed that the network could have increased its block size instead in order to allow Bitcoin to grow as a currency. Together, this group formed a plan to split from the Bitcoin blockchain and created Bitcoin Cash with a larger block capacity limit of 8 MB. Bitcoin went ahead with their plan to implement SegWit but the newly forked Bitcoin Cash did not implement SegWit. On 15 May 2018, the Bitcoin Cash block size limit was subsequently increased from 8 MB to 32 MB.
On 15 November 2018, Bitcoin Cash experienced a chain split from within its own community that resulted in the creation of Bitcoin SV. The creators of Bitcoin SV argued that Bitcoin Cash is no longer staying true to the original vision of the Bitcoin Whitepaper and decided to split off to form their own coin.
How does Bitcoin Cash differ from Bitcoin?
As Bitcoin Cash is a result of a chain split from Bitcoin, it shares much of Bitcoin’s fundamental workings. In fact, they even share the same history. 
Due to it being a fork of bitcoin, all on-chain data prior to the split are inherited. If you owned 1 bitcoin before the creation of Bitcoin Cash, you now have 1 BTC and 1 BCH, which can both be signed using the same private keys.
Source: Reddit r/btc
However, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are not non-interoperable. You cannot send your Bitcoin Cash to the Bitcoin network and somehow own 2 BTC. Your bitcoin cash and bitcoin now exists on two different sets of blockchains.
One of the main differences between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash is the block size limit and transaction fee. As Bitcoin Cash has bigger blocks and arguably lower usage, sending Bitcoin Cash on the network is relatively cheaper and faster than if done on Bitcoin. In that sense, Bitcoin Cash does serve as a faster and more efficient form of digital currency as extolled by Bitcoin Cash proponents.
How do I store my Bitcoin Cash?
If you are new to cryptocurrencies or are not careful with key management, it can be confusing to deal with Bitcoin Cash especially if you own Bitcoin and other Bitcoin-forks.
Bitcoincash.org recommends a few wallets to use when storing your Bitcoin Cash. However, always do your own due diligence to select the best wallets that suit your needs.
One way of mitigating risk is to use hardware wallets such as Trezor and Ledger. Hardware wallets are essentially external devices that look like USB memory sticks. A hardware wallet secures your private key that holds your Bitcoin into an external device outside of your personal computer so you do not need to worry if your computer is infected with malware. When you intend to transact, you simply connect the hardware wallet onto your personal computer and all the key signing would be done in the hardware itself.
Another point to note is that you should always check the address which you intend to send your Bitcoin Cash to. Mistakenly sending your Bitcoin Cash to a Bitcoin or Bitcoin SV address will mean the loss of your coin entirely. 
Who Created Bitcoin Cash?
There are several prominent leaders behind Bitcoin Cash, one of them being Roger Ver.
Can I Trade Bitcoin Cash Derivatives?
Yes, if you are looking to enter a long or short Bitcoin Cash position, both perpetual swaps and futures are available for trading. Perpetual futures markets for Bitcoin Cash are available on various exchanges for you to trade.

VeChain began in 2015 as a private consortium chain, working with a host of enterprises to explore applications of blockchain. VeChain would begin their transition to public blockchain in 2017 with the ERC-20 token VEN, before launching a mainnet of their own in 2018 using the ticker VET.
VeChain aims to use distributed governance and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to create an ecosystem which solves major data hurdles for multiple global industries from medical to energy, food & beverage to sustainability and SDG goals. By leveraging the power of trustless data, VeChain is building the digital backbone that will underpin the fourth industrial revolution, which demands real-time and trustless data sharing between many participants.
The platform uses two tokens, VET and VTHO, to manage and create value based on its VeChainThor public blockchain. VET generates VTHO and acts as the store of value and value transfer medium. VTHO is used to pay for GAS costs, separating the need to expend VET when writing data. This has the additional benefit of ensuring costs of using the network can be kept stable by tweaking certain variables such as the amount of VTHO required to service a transaction, or by increasing the VTHO generation rate. Such actions first require all-stakeholder community votes.
VeChain has been able to demonstrate massively boosted efficiency, traceability and transparency across data trails, supply chains and within novel kinds of ecosystems, such as those in San Marino targeting UN SDGs, among others.

34,filecoin,"What is Filecoin?
Filecoin is a decentralized storage network based on the Interplanetary File Storage (IPFS) protocol. It is designed to utilized unused storage globally into an efficient storage market for users to pay for low cost storage. The objective is to ensure file storage is permanent and distributed across the web. Contrast this with centralized cloud storage solution such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, or Dropbox, where data are stored in servers owned by these private corporations.
Filecoin (FIL or ⨎) is also the currency of the decentralized storage network. Customers wanting to access storage will have to pay for storage in Filecoin. Nodes that provide storage to the network will in turn be paid in Filecoin for their service.

What is IPFS?
IPFS stands for Interplanetary File Storage, a peer-to-peer storage and file system protocol developed by Protocol Labs. When a file is uploaded to the IPFS network, the file is designated a unique signature, and multiple nodes can host a whole or portion of that file. These files can be requested by any user with access to the address through the unique signature. As any nodes can store a copy of the file, it is distributed thus giving resilience to the file's existence on the internet. Many haven liken IPFS to be as important as the Bittorrent protocol created by Bram Cohen.

According to the Electric Capital Developer Report, the Internet Computer is one of the fastest growing developer ecosystems in 2021 — growing 368%. As of January 17, 2022, evidenced by over 28,000 canister smart contracts deployed on the network, over a thousand developers are hard at work building on the Internet Computer, encompassing DeFi, play-to-earn and GameFi, NFTs and marketplaces, instant message and social media dapps, enterprise software, as well as infrastructure and metaverse projects. Most importantly, once the developer community agrees on a token standard, Internet Computer-based projects will soon tokenize and list on exchanges.   

 
 DeFi: Next-generation decentralized exchanges such as Sonic, InfinitySwap, and ICPSwap, running entirely on-chain, are leveraging the Internet Computer’s reverse-gas model and 1 second transaction finality to give users zero gas fees and lightning fast speed for swaps, transactions, and more.
 
 
 NFT: The lead artist behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, debuted a new collection of NFTs on the Internet Computer at Art Basel, “The new series is hosted on the Internet Computer… allowing for bigger file sizes. It's an example of how artists are starting to experiment with NFT platforms beyond Ethereum.” ORIGYN, a NFT marketplace building on the Internet Computer, saw its valuation soar to $300 million following a round of investment from Paris Hilton and Wall Street veteran Bill Ackman.
 
 
 Games: Cube Run is a futuristic racing game built on the Unity 3D game engine, WebGL and hosted on the Internet Computer. MetaSports Basketball is an open basketball metaverse, where users utilize their favorite Ethereum and Internet Computer-based NFTs to compete to become basketball superstars on teams they own and manage. 
 
 
 Social media: OpenChat boasts 100,000 users, with close to 1 million messages sent over its decentralized messaging service. Distrikt, a decentralized Facebook, surpassed 70,000 user accounts and 100,000 posts — with less than $100 spent on gas. Dmail is the Web3 replacement for e-mail, and enables users to send and receive blockchain-backed, encrypted messages. DSocial is a decentralized version of YouTube, enabling content creators to be fairly rewarded via tokens for their work, and engagement.
 
 
 Metaverse: PokedStudios launched the Bots NFT collection in an early foray into the metaverse on the Internet Computer, with the rarest Bot netting a sale of 3,000 ICP (~$172,140). IC Gallery is an interoperable 3D metaverse blending GameFi and DeFi, where users can play, mint, and trade all their existing NFTs through various immersive 3D experiences.

ICP is Internet Computer's native token. It plays three prominent roles:

 
Network Governance: Users that participate in the governance will be rewarded with ICPI
 
Production of Cycles for Compute: ICP can be converted into cycles where it is used as the transaction fee to access the network. Cycles are burned after used.
 
Rewarding Users: ICP is used as the rewards to incentivize users to participate in the network such as securing the network.

The ICP protocol consists of the following major components working in conjunction:

 
 Internet Computer Consensus (ICC): The Internet Computer has 4-layers: (i) P2P layer, (ii) consensus layer, (iii) message routing layer, and (iv) execution environment. The novel Internet Computer Consensus (ICC) mechanism is divided into four layers: a notary layer, blockchain layer, random beacon layer and identity layer. Ultimately, allowing for industry-leading reliability and security of the blockchain.  
 
 
 Neurons: Neurons allow users to stake their ICP utility tokens to vote on governance proposals that upgrade the network. Users earn rewards ranging from 11% to 22% annualized returns for voting on proposals. Developers can also unstake their ICP and convert them into cycles to pay for computation and storage.
 
 
 Canister Smart Contracts: A canister smart contract is an evolution of traditional, limited first-generation smart contracts. Canisters consist of WebAssembly code and memory. Unlike legacy blockchains, cycles are paid by developers, ensuring users don’t pay for gas fees, and removing a major adoption barrier for Web3 users. Most importantly, canister smart contracts will soon be upgraded to 300 GB — enabling memory-intensive 3D and generative NFTs, as well as sophisticated DeFi and mass-market social media, games, and metaverse projects. 
 
 
 Mokoto: While Internet Computer developers can build Web3 dapps using any language that compiles to WebAssembly such as Rust, Go, C/C++. TypeScript, Java, Python, Ruby, Swift, etc, Motoko is a new programming language designed for building Web3 dapps on the Internet Computer. Easy to learn for Solidity and JavaScript developers. Created by the Motoko team at DFINITY, and led by WebAssembly co-creator Andreas Rossberg.

How does ICP work?
 
The decentralised network of ICP is hosted by a series of data centres of multiple nodes. Different nodes from within different data centres are pooled together and referred to as a ‘subnet’. Each subnet can host its own Proof-of-Stake blockchain by using a unique consensus model known as ‘Threshold Relay’. There are two important pillars that charge the operations of ICP forwards:

 
Chain Key Technology: Chain Key Technology is a 48-byte public chain key that enables Internet Computer to operate at web speed, allowing transactions to be finalised in 1-2 seconds. Though this is impressive, this is nevertheless insufficient, because a faster speed is needed to provide competitive user experiences, requiring responses to be provided to users in milliseconds. Chain Key Technology solves this further by splitting smart contract function execution into two types, known as ‘update calls’ and ‘query calls’ – where update calls take 1-2 seconds to finalize and query calls can be executed in milliseconds.
 
Network Nervous System (NNS): The NNS is responsible for managing everything from ICP’s economics and upgrades to network structure. The NNS is hosted within the network itself, and it acts as an autonomous ‘master’ blockchain with a public key to validate transactions in the ICP network. The NNS will also instigate proposals to a vote, such as the onboarding of new node machines, which are then voted upon by users who have their ICP tokens locked up. NNS is essentially the governance system whereas neurons represent the voting power. 

How does ICP differ from other coins?
One of ICP’s objectives was to solve the scaling problems experienced by Ethereum, without compromising on security or decentralisation. For example, EOS has previously been criticized for such a compromise. 

 
 Network Nervous System (NNS) DAO: The world’s largest permissionless DAO by TVL ($10.3bn), as of January 5, 2022, and participants (536,962 wallets). The NNS DAO is an open, permissionless and decentralized algorithmic system governing the Internet Computer, which automatically upgrades the protocol based on proposals adopted by the community, and continuously adds new nodes allowing the blockchain network to infinitely scale.  
 
 
 Low On-Chain Data Storage Costs: Decentralized data storage on the Internet Computer costs $0.46 per 1 GB / month or $5 per 1 GB / year. In comparison, it costs $310m (Ethereum) and $800k (Solana), as of January 17, 2022,  to store 1 GB per year on legacy blockchains. As a result, legacy blockchains rely on centralized cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Cloud, etc for off-chain data storage. For the first time, the low cost of decentralized data storage via the Internet Computer allows entrepreneurs and developers to run Web3 dapps entirely on-chain.
 
 
 User-Friendly Web3 Experience: The Internet Computer is the only public blockchain that runs smart contracts that directly serves HTTP calls to users, which means Web3 dapps on the Internet Computer have the same high quality user-friendly experience of today’s mass-market Web2 apps and games such as TikTok and Fortnite. Most importantly, Web3 dapps on the Internet Computer run on censorship-resistant, sovereign infrastructure. Currently, today’s biggest DeFi and DEXs such as Uniswap, SushiSwap, Aave, Curve, Compound, etc depend on centralized cloud services such as AWS, Cloudflare, and Netlify for their user-facing front ends – the part of a website or service that users see and interact with. For the first time, entrepreneurs and developers are able to build censorship-resistant DeFi and Web3 dapps that’s decentralized from end to end using the Internet Computer — without centralized cloud technology, which can easily be turned off as seen by the deplatforming of social media site Parler in 2021.         
 
 
 Reverse Gas Model: Cycles are the computational resource (aka, gas) required to execute transactions on the Internet Computer. Unlike legacy blockchains, the Internet Computer has a reverse-gas model where developers pay to run Web3 dapps, DeFi, games, NFTs, social media, and metaverse projects. Similar to the success of Web2, the Internet Computer lowers the barrier for mass market adoption by allowing users to interact with Web3 dapps without needing tokens or token wallets — no longer paying gas fees to mint NFTs, process DeFi transactions, play games, engage on social media dapps, etc. 
 
 
 Anonymity: Users of Internet Computer-based Web3 dapps, DeFi, games, NFTs, social media, and metaverse use Internet Identity, the only anonymizing blockchain authentication system leveraging cryptographically enabled devices such as the fingerprint sensor (TouchID) on a laptop, FaceID system on mobile, or portable HSM devices such as YubiKey or Ledger wallet, to anonymously authenticate to Web3 dapps without being tracked across dapps and services, and preserving a users anonymity. At Genesis launch, DFINITY made node specifications public, which allows node providers to independently procure or build node machines. As a next step, DFINITY and the technical community are developing (see Roadmap) ways for amatuer node providers, using low cost devices, to participate and further decentralize the Internet Computer network.      
 
 
 100% Sovereign Infrastructure: Similar to the Bitcoin network, the Internet Computer is the only other 100% sovereign infrastructure in blockchain — with zero centralized cloud nodes. Currently, 70% of Ethereum nodes and over 50% of Solana nodes are hosted by centralized cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Cloud, etc, allowing tech giants to shut down or degrade performance of legacy blockchain networks. Currently, as of January 17, 2022, there are 413 sovereign, censorship-resistant Internet Computer nodes operated by independent node providers around the globe, leaving the Internet Computer immune to shut down by centralized parties.   
 
 
 Infinite Scalability: The Internet Computer’s partitioning into subnet blockchains allows the network to infinitely scale. Each subnet (aka, mini blockchain), composed of 13 to 37 nodes to ensure Byzantine fault tolerance, exists within the larger Internet Computer blockchain. Continuously increasing the number of subnets also increases network throughput, or overall block rate. As of January 14, 2021, the Internet Computer supports an industry-leading 32 blocks per second. 
 
 
 Lightning Fast Speed: The Internet Computer blockchain is designed to consistently process an immense volume of updates and transactions without compromising on speed, security, sovereignty, or decentralization. Recently, Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal stated, “The Internet Computer is bloody fast”. ICP is capable of processing up to 250,000 queries (read) per second, executed with an average 1 second finality (write) for Web3 dapps — “making it 11 times faster than Solana” according to Origyn co-founder Mike Schwartz.

37,decentraland,"What is Decentraland?
Have you read or watched Ready Player One? If you have then you know where we are headed. Decentraland is a decentralized VR (virtual reality) world that is powered by the Ethereum blockchain. In this virtual world, you can purchase land, build it, monetize, and immerse into the applications and content that is built by other users. What distinguishes Decentraland from other VR projects is its decentralized nature. Land and in-game currency are powered by the Ethereum blockchain which give users complete ownership and promotes transparency.

What is MANA?
MANA refers to the native currency in Decentraland. It is an ERC-20 token powered by the Ethereum blockchain. Users can currently use MANA to purchase LAND and also pay for goods and services in Decentraland. MANA token can be purchased from various centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges, and swap services.
What is LAND?
The concept of LAND in Decentraland refers to a parcel of land in the 3D virtual world. LAND is a non-fundigble token (NFT) powered by the Ethereum blockchain. Users have the opportunity to permanently own any LAND they purchase as the land titles are all traceable through the blockchain. They would then have total control on any 3D scenes they would like to build on the LAND. Individual parcels of land can be combined into estates to form larger plots of land. You may purchase LAND from secondary markets such as the Marketplace or OpenSea.
How do I keep my MANA safe?
Since MANA is an ERC-20 token, you can store it in any Ethereum compatible wallet. To stay secure, a good recommendation would be to use a hardware wallet such as Trezor or Ledger. If you are looking to interact with the Decentraland smart contracts, you an opt for wallets such as Metamask, MyEtherWallet, or MyCrypto.

38,hedera-hashgraph,"Hedera is a decentralized public network where developers can build secure, fair applications with near real-time consensus. The platform is owned and governed by a council of global innovators including Avery Dennison, Boeing, Deutsche Telekom, DLA Piper, FIS (WorldPay), Google, IBM, LG Electronics, Magalu, Nomura, Swirlds, Tata Communications, University College London (UCL), Wipro, and Zain Group. 
The Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) acts as a trust layer for any application or permissioned network and allows for the creation of an immutable and verifiable log of messages. Application messages are submitted to the Hedera network for consensus, given a trusted timestamp, and fairly ordered. Use HCS to track assets across a supply chain, create auditable logs of events in an advertising platform, or even use it as a decentralized ordering service.

Chain has launched Chain Core which is a permissioned and open source blockchain and Sequence, its ledger as a service product. Clients can receive discounts and pay for commercial fees with Chain Tokens (XCN) as well as participate in community protocol governance and access to premium features."
40,tezos,"Tezos is a coin created by a former Morgan Stanley analyst, Arthur Breitman. It is a smart contract platform which is does not involve in mining Tezos coins. It is a coin that promotes themselves on major ideas of self-amendment and on-chain governance. It is an Ethereum-like blockchain that hosts smart contracts. It allows the community to vote and improve its flaws. Any token holder may delegate their voting rights to others in the network. The coin uses a generic network shell which allow different transaction and consensus protocols that a blockchain needs to be compatible.
The source code is implemented on OCaml which is a fast, flexible and functional programming language which should suit an ambitious project and its technical requirements. Tezos’ proof-of-stake consensus algorithm is different from the delegated proof-of-stake (dPOS) where they go by the name liquid proof-of-stake. This liquid proof-of-stake that Tezos uses focus in filling the gap between both security and decentralization but still being able to take advantage of the benefits that delegated proof-of-stake offers. The staking process in Tezos is called “baking”. In this blockchain, bakers who make deposits will be rewarded for signing up and publishing blocks. However, if a baker commits any bad behavior the deposits will be forfeited.
Baking & Endorsing
Baking is what Tezos refers to as the action of signing and publishing a new block in the chain. Bakers need at least 8,000 XTZ to qualify as a delegate, and having additional delegated stake increases their chances of being selected as a Baker or Endorser.
At the beginning of each cycle (4096 blocks), the Bakers for each block are randomly selected and published. Bakers earn a block reward of 40 XTZ for baking a block.
In addition to the Baker, 32 Endorsers are randomly selected to verify the last block that was baked. Endorsers receive 1.25 XTZ for each block they endorse.
Block Rewards & Inflation
Block rewards are funded by protocol defined inflation. Rewards are calibrated so that the number of XTZ tokens grows at roughly 5.5% per year. If 100% of Tezos tokens are delegated, the annualized yield will be 5.5%. As of May 2021, approximately 78.8% of Tezos tokens have been delegated, including the 10% owned by the Tezos Foundation, so the annualized yield is roughly 5.8%.
To ensure Bakers and Endorsers act honestly, they are required to post a security deposit for each block they Bake or Endorse. They forfeit this deposit in the event of malicious activity, such as double baking or double endorsing a block.
In 2018, Tezos successfully launched their main network after delaying the launch due to corporate governance disputes. The Tezos foundation planned to transition the network to a mainnet, or a more complete version. The foundation has also raised $232 million in July 2017 to build the network and issue a new type of cryptocurrency to its backers in one of the largest- ever initial coin offerings. The founders have also made it clear in their blog that the network is using a new blockchain technology hence unexpected issues may still occur affecting the network

44,theta-token,"What is Theta Network?

Theta network is a decentralized video streaming network that is powered by blockchain technology. Theta allows users to watch video content and get rewarded with tokens as they share their internet bandwidth and computing resources on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis. Besides a line-up of institutional investors like Node Capital and DHVC, Theta Network is advised by Steve Chen, co-founder of YouTube, and Justin Kan, co-founder of Twitch.
How does THETA work?
The video streaming services on Theta rely on a distributed network of users who voluntarily contribute their spare bandwidth and computing resources to run Theta’s system, in return for Theta Fuel (TFuel) reward.
Theta runs on a modified proof-of-stake consensus mechanism as it has a unique multi-Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) which combines a committee of 20-30 Validator nodes with a second later of thousands of Guardian nodes. This acts to speed up approvals and is faster than traditional proof-of-work networks. Theta’s multi-BFT design achieves a healthy balance between consistency, speed, and decentralization.
With this architecture in place, Theta’s Network’s content storage and delivery capabilities are powered by Theta Edge Nodes. Besides the Validator and Guardian nodes, community members of Theta also operate the Theta Edge Nodes, which make up the Theta Edge Network that is fully decentralized for data delivery and edge computing. Crucially, edge nodes allow users to capture live video, transcode and relay video content as well as share bandwidth across the network globally without the need for centralised servers. As of April 2021, the edge network has as many as 30,000 nodes, if not more; making it the backbone for Theta’s P2P content-sharing ecosystem.
In addition, Theta can support Turing-complete smart contracts. These smart contracts open a new avenue for various user experiences, as more DApps are built on the Theta network. Subsequently, Theta launched the Theta Token Minter which allows any user to create new TNT-20 tokens on the Theta blockchain with no smart contract experience required – meaning users can input token name, ticker symbol, and supply parameters of their new token and the Token Minter will mint the new tokens. This seamless and non-technical way to mint tokens on the Theta blockchain invites a wide range of DApps and assets that can be built on the protocol.
Theta Network operates on a dual token design:
THETA is the native token for Theta Network that serves multiple governance tasks. THETA is used to stake as a Validator or Guardian node. Its Validator notes are run by Google, Blockchain Ventures, Samsung, Sony Europe and Binance, along with a network of community-run Guardian nodes. By staking and operating a node, users earn a proportional amount of new Theta Fuel.
Theta Fuel (TFUEL) is the operational token of the Theta protocol. TFUEL is used for on-chain transactions such as rewarding Edge Nodes relayers for sharing video content, or for interacting with smart contracts. So, TFUEL can be earned by relayers of the Edge network for every video stream they relay to other users on the p2p network.
Why was this project started?
Theta aims to provide blockchain-enabled solutions to issues, such as poor quality and inefficient bottlenecks, faced by the traditional video streaming system.  Currently, most centralized video streaming platforms suffer from poor infrastructure and high costs that result in poor user experience.

45,aave,"Aave is a decentralized money market protocol where users can lend and borrow cryptocurrency across 20 different assets as collateral.
The protocol has a native token called AAVE, which is also a governance token that lets the community decide the direction of the protocol in a collective manner.
Lenders can earn interest by providing liquidity to the market, while borrowers can borrow by collateralizing their cryptoassets to take out loans from the liquidity pools.
What is the origin and history of Aave?

Aave was previously known as ETHLend when it was founded in November 2017 by Stani Kulechov and has successfully raised $16.2 million through an ICO round. ETHLend was then rebranded to Aave in September 2018.
Its native token, Aave (AAVE), was launched in October 2020 as one of Aave’s initiatives to become self-governed. Following the token’s launch, a 1:100 token migration must be made from the old token.
At the moment, Aave has integrated, partnered, and collaborated with 30 companies, notably Curve, 1inch, and Synthetix. You can find out more information here: https://aave.com/ecosystem/.
Fun fact: Aave is a Finnish word translated to “ghost” in English, which illustrates the protocol’s goal to be transparent and an open infrastructure in DeFi.
Who is the founder of Aave?
At the time of writing, the Aave team is made up of 29 individuals with Stani Kulechov as the CEO.
How does the protocol works?
Users who use the Aave platform can utilize the lending and borrowing functionality across 20 supported cryptocurrencies such as Dai (DAI), Uni (UNI), and Yearn.Finance (YFI)
Lenders can earn interest by providing liquidity in the market. There will be two sources of earnings by providing liquidity: (1) the interest rate paid on loans and (2) a percentage of flash loan fees.
Borrowers could opt for the loan to be on a fixed or variable rate, whichever is the best for them.
In the latest v2 release, users can protect themselves from liquidation by swapping their collateral with a different asset.
Lastly, Aave’s main unique product is a “flash loan” where borrowers can take up the loan with zero collateralization. However, the borrower must pay back the loan and any additional interest, plus the fees within the same transaction.
What is the AAVE token?
The token has 3 primary roles within the platform:

 
 Governance
 
 
 Incentives
 
 
 Mitigation tool
 

Governance
Incentives
Mitigation tool
How is the token used for governance?
AAVE can be used to vote and decide on the protocol’s upgrade via Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs).

(Image source: https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/governance)
How is the token used as an incentive?
AAVE can be staked within the protocol, and the users can earn the protocol’s staking rewards and fees. There are two ways to stake: (1) Stake AAVE and earn rewards in AAVE or (2) Stake Balancer Pool Token (BPT) and earn AAVE, BAL, and trading fees from Balancer. 
How is the token used as a mitigation tool?
In the event of associated shortfalls, the staked AAVE will act as insurance to cover the deficit. 
For example, your staked assets will be slashed up to 30% when Aave protocol is in a deficit state for the liquidity providers.
Who has audited Aave?
Since 2019, Aave has been audited 13 times and they were done by Trail of Bits, Open Zeppelin, Consensys Diligence, Certik, Peckshield, and Certora. 
Is there a difference between Version 1 and Version 2?
Aave’s second iteration has introduced several interesting new features.
One of the notable ones is the collateral swap feature. This allows users to swap their collateral to another supported asset at any given time. It is a great feature, especially for those who want to avoid liquidation.
Another feature is loan repayment with collateral, enabling the borrowers to close their loan positions by paying directly with their collateral in just one transaction.
Do I need to do anything to migrate from Version 1 to Version 2?
Aave v2 is just a protocol upgrade and its native token won’t be affected by the changes.
Hence, if you are holding AAVE, you do not need to do anything.
Additionally, if you have loan positions on Aave v1, you do not need to close them either. Aave released a migration tool to help you migrate your positions. To know more on how to migrate your loan positions, kindly refer to this blog post.
Can I long or short Aave?
Yes, you can long or short Aave via perpetual swap or futures such as FTX, Binance Futures, and OKEx. 
 
These derivative exchanges are not formally regulated and can provide even up to 125x leverage. Derivative contracts are high-risk products, and you might want to understand what you are doing before participating in them.

46,elrond-erd-2,"What is Elrond?
Elrond aims to build a high-throughput blockchain that aspires to build the next internet-scale blockchain.
Recognizing that most scalability efforts by other projects are not sufficient in that the efforts are merely “kicking the can down the road”, Elrond set out to create a blockchain that is capable of 1000x throughput than most existing blockchains. This improvement of transaction throughput allows Elrond to handle even the most aggressive wave of user adoption.
What are Elrond’s Key Features?

 
 Adaptive State Sharding - Real-time splitting and merging of shards as the demand for network capacity changes. At any time, the Elrond blockchain will juggle between network sharding, transaction sharding and state sharding, making the network capacity highly malleable as user demand requires.
 
 
 Secure Proof of Stake (""SPoS"") consensus mechanism - In line with Sharding, the Elrond Blockchain elects different validators within each shards in every validation round.
 
 
 Elrond VM - The Elrond Virtual Machine (EVM) is a dedicated smart contract execution engine built on WASM. Developers can build on The EVM in whichever language they’re familiar with to be compiled in WASM.

The team believes that TrueUSD will be able to come up with the stable trading instrument for the traders of cryptocurrency that has been long-awaited. This will allow the businesses and consumers to use the digital currency as a medium of an exchange. The goal of the TrueUSD team was to build a coin that is stable and which can be used and trusted by them too. TrustToken is a platform that creates the tokens backed by assets that can easily be purchased and sold all around the world. The first asset token of TrustToken is TrueUSD, which is a stable coin and can be redeemed 1-for-1 for US dollars. TrustToken have partnered with registered fiduciaries and banks for holding the funds securely backed by TrueUSD tokens. To increase the amount of security, fiduciaries, and banks directly handle all the funds. Escrowed funds do not give access to the TrueUSD system.
TrueUSD works with various trust companies which already manage around billions of dollars. Just pass an AML/KYC check, send USD to a trust company with an agreement of escrow. When the funds get verified, their API tells the smart contract of TUSD to mint an equal amount of TUSD to your public Ethereum address.
The USD funds are regularly verified in scheduled attestations by a very much trusted auditing firm. USD funds are kept safely in a third party account, that is escrow accounts, wherein TrustToken does not hold any direct access to the funds and cannot abscond with them even if they wish to. The token burning and minting system makes sure that every TUSD token is backed by 1 USD.
A mandatory check of AML/KYC makes sure that TUSD keeps shady people away from the entire project. TUSD makes faster transactions in low transaction fees. Even though TUSD is a unique offering, it is most likely overshadowed by its bigger competitors - Tether. While TUSD arguably offers more security and features, it may be losing the marketing battle. This is not to say that the situation will remain the same. With more crypto investors joining the market every day, the good times for TUSD may be on their way."
51,bitcoin-cash-sv,"What Is Bitcoin SV (BSV)? 
 
Bitcoin SV (BSV) emerged following a hard fork of the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain in 2018, which had in turn forked from the BTC blockchain a year earlier. 
The goal of Bitcoin SV is to fulfil the original vision of the Bitcoin protocol and design as described in Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper, early Bitcoin client software and known Satoshi writings. BSV aims to offer scalability and stability in line with the original description of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, as well as deliver a distributed data network that can support enterprise-level advanced blockchain applications. 
To this end, it has removed artificial block size limits and re-enabled Script commands and other technical capabilities which had been historically disabled or restricted by the protocol developers of the BTC blockchain. This allows the network to process tens of thousands of transactions per second while maintaining extremely low transaction fees for micropayments, in addition to offering advanced capabilities such as tokens, smart contracts, computation and other data use cases. 
The BSV network is unique in its capacity for unbounded on-chain scaling while also being more aligned with the original design of Bitcoin than any other blockchain. 
Who are the founders of Bitcoin SV (BSV)? 
Blockchain technology company nChain developed the BSV node software and has regularly delivered protocol updates that restore the functionality of the original Bitcoin protocol. nChain now provides the Bitcoin SV Infrastructure Team which continues to advance the node software and other infrastruture tools for the BSV network. 
nChain Chief Scientist Craig Wright, who has claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, has been a supporter of BSV since the split between BCH and BSV in 2018, following the proposal of controversial protocol changes by several BCH developers. 
Entrepreneur Calvin Ayre is also a vocal advocate for BSV and regularly seeks investment opportunities in companies and projects building on the blockchain. 
After BSV split from BCH, a Switzerland-based non-profit industry association known as Bitcoin Association was formed that now supports the global growth and adoption of the BSV blockchain and digital currency. Work of the Bitcoin SV Infrastructure Team at nChain is performed at the request and direction of Bitcoin Association. 
What makes Bitcoin SV (BSV) unique? 
BSV differs from other versions of Bitcoin in its adherence to the original Bitcoin protocol and focus on realising the vision for the Bitcoin network outlined in the Bitcoin white paper and other known Satoshi Nakamoto writings. Unlike BTC, which now primarily functions as an investment or store of value asset, BSV aims to offer a scalable and usable blockchain platform for efficient payments and distributed data applications for consumer, enterprise and government users. 
Thanks to its unbounded block size, BSV can scale to meet market forces and accommodate the demands of any application and payment network without resorting to second-layer solutions. In 2021, the BSV network mined the world’s first gigabyte (1000+ megabytes) level blocks – reaching up to 2 GBs in August 2021; for comparison, 2 GBs is 2000 times the 1MB block cap of the BTC network. Block capacity of the BSV network is expected to continue growing further to support more transaction volume and data use caes. 
With testing of the new node software, the BSV Infrastructure Team has already demonstrated the BSV network’s ability to handle up to 100,000 transactions per second and expects that capacity to be shown on the BSV mainnet and grow even higher in the future. With this capability, BSV rivals and aims to supersede the payment processing capabilities of platforms like VISA at a fraction of the cost to users. 
BSV also offers a scalable and product-ready platform for blockchain application developers, many of whom have migrated from other networks such as Ethereum after encountering scaling issues as their adoption increased. BSV is capable of scaling along with user adoption, which means developers can be assured that transaction fees will remain low and interactions will be processed quickly. 
The functionality of BSV is attractive to enterprise and government users, with the blockchain offering an efficient and stable platform for companies and agencies looking to experiment or build with blockchain technology. 
How many Bitcoin SV (BSV) coins are there in circulation? 
As defined by the original Bitcoin protocol, there will be a maximum of 21 million BSV coins in circulation. Fresh coins from this circulation are distributed to BSV miners via block rewards, which they earn in addition to transaction fees for validating blocks. 
Block rewards for miners are cut by 50% at predefined periods to slowly shift the reliance of miners on these subsidies to transaction fees and to reduce the flow of new tokens as they approach their maximum quantity. 
How Is the Bitcoin SV network secured? 
BSV is secured by the proof-of-work consensus mechanism as described in the Bitcoin white paper. This means that for a block containing new transactions to be added to the blockchain, miners must solve a complex mathematical problem using their computer’s processing power. The miner who solves this problem first earns the block reward and transaction fees, and their block is added to the chain. 
As more blocks are built on top of their block, the validity of the transactions now stored on the chain are ratified by other nodes and become very difficult, if not virtually impossible, to alter. 
Where can you buy Bitcoin SV (BSV)? 
Bitcoin SV is listed on major exchanges including OKEx, KuCoin, Huobi, Bitfinex, Bittrex, Bithumb — as well as dozens of additional platforms. It is also available to purchase from BuyBSV.com. "
52,celsius-degree-token,"What is Celsius Network?
Celsius Network is a P2P lending platform allowing users to borrow and lend cryptocurrencies. The system is based on the Celsius Network native token, CEL.
By using their cryptocurrencies as collateral, borrowers can easily have access to fiat currencies with a small interest rate without the need to sell their cryptocurrencies. 
Lenders are paid an interest rate for the cryptocurrency that was deposited in their Celsius Network wallet.
How does it work?
Users can earn interest by depositing cryptocurrencies into Celsius Network. The interest is paid weekly and users have the option to withdraw at any time. To make things better, users are not charged whenever they deposit or withdraw funds. 
Users can also earn “Bonus Interest” through the Celsius Loyalty Rewards. For example, if the overall wallet balance has 20% in CEL tokens, users will be deemed as a Platinum Celsius member, thus obtaining a 30% Bonus Interest and 30% Loan interest discount.

Is it safe to store your cryptocurrencies with Celsius Network?
To protect assets that are deposited in the platform’s cold wallet, Celsius Network has partnered with BitGo. Through this, BitGo will cover any losses by offering up to $100 million in insurance for these assets. 
It is also worth noting that the company does not directly grant insurance on crypto deposits. In other words, during the event of a cyber attack, users are vulnerable to losing their assets­. In those situations, Celsius Network promises to use its balance sheet to offset the damages to its clients. However, their Terms of Use do not guarantee the return of funds in the case of a breach. 
Background
Celsius Network was founded by Alex Mashinsky in 2017. The company exists based on the fundamental idea of decentralization by allowing people to unbank themselves and substituting the existing financial structures with a new model.

54,the-graph,"
What is The Graph?
It is an indexing protocol and a global API aimed at organizing blockchain data, while making it easily accessible via GraphQL. Developers can use Graph Explorer to search, find, and publish all the public data they need to build decentralized applications. This makes it possible for developers build serverless dApps that run entirely on public infrastructures.
Who are the founders?
It was founded by Yaniv Tal (Project Lead), Jannis Pohlman (Tech Lead), and Brandom Ramirez (Research Lead)
Who are the investors?
They closed a $5 million private token sale funded by Coinbase Ventures, Framework Ventures, Digital Currency Group, and more; while also did a $2.5 million seed round led by Multicoin Capital. A public sale round of $12 million was also concluded few months before the launch of mainnet.
How does the protocol work?
Developers can define a subgraph which specifies how blockchain data are structured to be consumed by app and dapp developers. App and dapp developers can query the network using subgraph schemas with GraphQL which are paid in GRT tokens.
These data are served by indexers who act as nodes, incentivized with GRT tokens to ensure that the API is always available in a decentralized manner and data are served correctly.
As there can be many subgraphs out there, curators are tasked to find the subgraphs that are most useful to developers. Curators are also incentivized with GRT tokens to find the best subgraph that others would find useful.
Who are its users?
Developers are able to obtain most of the essential Ethereum data through The Graph which includes data for Uniswap, Balancer, Curve, Aave, Moloch DAO, Compound, and more.
Apps and dapps that are using The Graph includes CoinGecko, Uniswap Info, Decentraland, Synthetix, Aragon, and more.
The service have also recently expanded to offer data from other blockchains such as Binance Smart Chain, Bitcoin, Cosmos, Avalanche, Flow, Polygon POS, Arbitrum, Celo, and more.
What is the GRT token?
GRT coin is the native token of the network that’s used to coordinate work. Node operators (called Indexers) can stake and earn GRT for processing queries. Anyone can delegate their tokens to indexers to secure the network and earn rewards. Curators organize data on The Graph by signaling GRT on useful APIs, called subgraphs. Indexers, Delegators, and Curators work together to organize the data for the crypto economy and maintain a useful global API for DeFi and Web3.

55,kucoin-shares,"KuCoin is an international cryptocurrency exchange based out of Seychelle that currently supports the trading of 250 digital assets. What’s unique about KuCoin is that they share 50% of their overall trading fee revenue with users holding their exchange-based token. In a similar fashion to Binance, KuCoin offers relatively low tradings fees and incentives for holding (or trading) its native cryptocurrency. Back in 2011, the founders started researching blockchain tech and went further to build the technical architecture for KuCoin in 2013. 4 years later, the exchange launched with the ultimate goal of “becoming one of the top 10 worldwide hottest exchange platform[s]” by 2019.
As stated on their official website which lists 12 core members, “Kucoin aims at providing users digital asset transaction and exchange services which are even more safe and convenient, integrating premium assets worldwide, and constructing state of the art transaction platform”. CEO and founder, Michael Gam, is a former technical expert at Ant Financial, an affiliate company of the Chinese Alibaba Group. He was also a senior partner at Internet giants like MikeCRM and KF5.COM. OO, Eric Don, is referred to as a “senior Internet researcher, systems architect, and Internet industry star”. He is also stated to be the CTO and senior partner of IT companies including YOULIN.COM, KITEME, and REINOT. However, it’s unclear if these websites actually exist as they did not show in a Google search or when entering the website domains. According to his LinkedIn, he is currently CTO at Youlin Network Technologies, yet there is no mention of KITEME or REINOT.
With its growing user base and increasing number of cryptocurrencies being offered, KuCoin may be set up for a strong run in the markets. KuCoin Shares volume is expected to grow as the daily trading volume on KuCoin, hence, trading fees collection grows & thus, the size of dividend payout grows. This can lure investors to hold KCS token which may even increase its value. KuCoin faces stiff competition from OKEx, but it expects to continue to grow its community exponentially as it is being projected to be one among the top 5 exchanges in the world. "

IOTA is a cryptocurrency that has no transaction fees and requires no miners in order to process transactions. It does, however, require some computational power to submit a transaction, making it perfect for machines to use as a currency and distributed communication protocol for the Internet of Things “IoT”. The main purpose of IOTA is to solve some of the major problems with Blockchain technology, the main one being that the bigger the Blockchain (such as Bitcoin), the slower, more expensive, and also more restricting it is to actually transfer funds. Another issue with the Blockchain is size, as more and more Blocks are added, the longer the Blockchain gets, and therefore the less amount of computers are able to mine it. Right now BTC is over 150GB long, and so is ETH. If this size increased tenfold, very few computers would be able to mine it at all.

59,zcash,"Zcash is a decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency that offers privacy and selective transparency of transactions. Zcash payments are published on a public blockchain, but the sender, recipient, and amount of a transaction remain private.
Zcash is based on peer-reviewed cryptographic research, and built by a security-specialized engineering team on an open source platform based on Bitcoin Core's battle-tested codebase. Our improvement over Bitcoin is the addition of privacy. Zcash uses advanced cryptographic techniques, namely zero-knowledge proofs, to guarantee the validity of transactions without revealing additional information about them.
How Zcash works
Zcash encrypts the contents of shielded transactions. Since the payment information is encrypted, the protocol uses a novel cryptographic method to verify their validity.
Zcash uses a zero-knowledge proof construction called a zk-SNARK, developed by our team of experienced cryptographers based on recent breakthroughs in cryptography. These constructions allow the network to maintain a secure ledger of balances without disclosing the parties or amounts involved. Instead of publicly demonstrating spend-authority and transaction values, the transaction metadata is encrypted and zk-SNARKs are used to prove that nobody is cheating or stealing.
Zcash also enables users to send public payments which work similarly to Bitcoin. With the support for both shielded and transparent addresses, users can choose to send Zcash privately or publicly. Zcash payments sent from a shielded address to a transparent address reveal the received balance, while payments from a transparent address to a shielded address protect the receiving value.

60,maker,"What is the Maker token (MKR)?

The Maker token (MRK) is a governance token that is used to govern and recapitalize the Maker protocol. Holders of the token can participate and vote on changes to the protocol’s smart contract and system parameters such as Stability Fees and the Dai Savings Rate (DSR).
 
What is Maker?
Maker is a smart contract lending platform that enables users to take out loans by locking-in collateral in exchange for Dai. It was founded by the Maker Foundation in 2015 as an open-source project to offer economic freedom and opportunities to anyone, anywhere. In 2017, it launched the Maker governance token (MKR) and its first stablecoin iteration known as the Single Collateral Dai (SAI), which used Ether (ETH) as collateral.
Two years later in 2019, the Foundation released the Multi-Collateral Dai (DAI), phasing out SAI. The platform has enjoyed widespread adoption and is the largest decentralized lending platform with around $2.58 billion in total value locked (TVL), as of December 2020.
What can the Maker token (MKR) do?
The Maker token has two core functions: i) governance and ii) recapitalization. In terms of governance, MKR token holders are responsible for monitoring, participating, and voting on proposals or changes to ensure the overall health of the Maker protocol. This is done via two types of polls which are executed through smart contracts: i) proposal polling and ii) executive polling.
The former is used to gauge the consensus of the Maker community towards a proposed change. It is a preliminary step, conducted to ensure that proposals are well thought out before formal voting begins in executive polling. In that stage, MKR holders officially vote to approve or disapprove a proposal. The smart contract address which receives the highest number of MKR tokens is then elected as the active proposal. Further details on polls can be found in Maker’s whitepaper.
Some examples of changes that have been proposed or implemented in the protocol are: adding a new collateral asset, modifying the Dai Savings Rate (DSR), choosing a set of oracle feeds and upgrading the Maker contract’s functionality. Users can view all current and previous polls, as well as their outcomes, on Maker’s governance page.  
The second function of the MKR token is recapitalization. In the event that system debt exceeds surplus, additional MKR tokens are minted by the protocol and sold for Dai through debt auctions to help bring the ecosystem back from insolvency. 
On the other hand, if system surplus exceeds debt, the protocol sells Dai via a surplus auction for MKR, which is subsequently burned. This mechanism incentivizes MKR holders to keep the system running as intended; bad governance will result in MKR value dilution and vice versa. More information on recapitalization can be found in Maker DAO’s community development page, while auctions are elaborated on here. 
Where and how do I obtain the Maker token (MKR)?
The most straightforward way to obtain the MKR token is from exchanges such as Binance or Uniswap. You can browse through the various centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges via the link provided. Alternatively, this page's markets tab also has a list of all the exchanges that are trading MKR pairs.
For more technically savvy users however, MKR can be acquired by participating in the protocol’s auctions. The Maker Docs page provides a useful auction bot setup guide for those who wish to do so.
How does Maker work? 
The Maker protocol functions similarly to a bank. It provides loans and charges interest on borrowings and savings denominated in its native stablecoin, Dai. 
In traditional finance, these services are only ever provided after fulfilling several stringent requirements such as the provision of sufficient collateral, robust credit scores and compliance with KYC and criminal background checks. With Maker however, users need only provide collateral in the form of cryptocurrencies. No KYC is needed, and loans are issued in a decentralized manner via smart contracts. 
In practice, a Dai loan is obtained by heading over to Oasis and locking-in collateral in smart contracts known as Maker Vaults. The loan amount would depend on two factors: i) the amount of collateral locked-in and ii) the chosen collateral’s collateralization ratio. 
For instance, if a user chooses Ether (ETH) as collateral and the collateralization ratio of ETH is 150%, then the user would need to lock-in 1.5 ETH for every 1 Dai he/she mints. And similar to a regular loan, a Dai loan will incur debt and accrue an interest fee known as the Stability Fee. However, it can also generate savings through the Dai Savings Rate mechanism (DSR). 
The Maker token thus keeps the Maker ecosystem functioning smoothly by determining what cryptocurrencies are suitable to be used as collateral, the collateralization ratio required for these assets, their associated Stability Fees, and the DSR. In effect, it serves to regulate Dai’s soft-peg to the US dollar and keep Vaults overcollateralized. 
Further explanation on the inner workings of Stability Fees, DSR and Dai can be read in the protocol’s whitepaper.

62,havven,"Synthetix Network Token (SNX) is an exchange-based token created and issued by Synthetix, a decentralized synthetic asset issuance protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain.
What is Synthetix?

Synthetix is a decentralized synthetic asset issuance protocol founded by Kain Warwick and the Synthetix Foundation. Initially, it was known as Havven when it first launched in September 2017. During its seed round and token sale, it managed to raise $30 million by selling 60 million HAV tokens to investors. In late 2018, the platform expanded its vision and rebranded to Synthetix. Today, the platform is the largest decentralized exchange for derivatives in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, boasting an impressive ~$700M in total value locked (TVL) as of November 2020.
What are synthetic assets?
Synthetic assets or Synths are derivatives that provide exposure to real world assets on the Ethereum blockchain. Similar to derivatives in traditional financial markets, Synths allow users to hedge and reduce their risk, speculate on price movements and gain access to unavailable assets or markets. This is all accomplished without an individual ever holding the underlying asset.
What can the SNX token do?
Synthetix Network Token (SNX) is primarily used as collateral to mint synthetic assets. SNX holders can head over to Mintr to stake their SNX into the Synthetix smart contract and create sUSD – synthetic United States dollars. The amount of sUSD minted will depend on two factors: i) the amount of SNX staked, and ii) the collateralization ratio (C-Ratio) of the platform. At present, the C-Ratio is 600%. This means that in order to mint 1 sUSD, a user would need to stake at least 6 SNX as collateral.
SNX is also used to earn rewards. SNX holders who stake their SNX into the platform are incentivized to do so through two main reward mechanisms: i) exchange rewards and ii) staking rewards. Exchange rewards are generated whenever a trade takes place on Synthetix, the value of which can range from 0.1-1% of the trade value, though it is typically 0.3%. Staking rewards meanwhile, are rewards from the protocol’s inflationary monetary supply. The new SNX generated by the protocol is given to SNX holders who stake their tokens. Both these rewards are distributed as SNX on a weekly, pro-rata basis and are escrowed for 1 year.  This is subject however, to an individual’s compliance with the target C-Ratio.
Synthetix also offers other time-limited incentives such as liquidity provider rewards. These can be viewed on Mintr by clicking the LP Rewards tab.
How do I obtain Synthetix Network Tokens (SNX)?
Synthetix Network Tokens (SNX) can be obtained by buying them from an exchange such as Binance or Uniswap. You can find SNX trading on various centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges via the link provided.
What kind of Synthetic Assets/Synths are there?
Synthetix Exchange lists all its supported synthetic assets under its Synths tab. For a broad categorization of the different Synth types, as well as further explanation of their inner workings, you can check out Synthetix’s litepaper. Broadly, there are 5 types of synthetic assets:

 Foreign Exchange (Forex): Synths that track the price of forex currencies
 
 Examples: sUSD, sEUR, sAUD etc.
 
 
 Commodity: Synths that track the price of commodities
 
 Examples: sOIL, sXAU, sXAG
 
 
 Crypto: Synths that track the price of cryptocurrencies
 
 Examples: sBTC, sETH, sXRP etc.
 
 
 Index: Synths that track an index - a basket of stocks or cryptocurrencies
 
 Examples: sDEFI, sCEX, sNIKKEI etc.
 
 
 Inverse (iSynths): Synths that inversely track the price of assets, such as cryptocurrencies or commodities
 
 Examples: iBTC, iETH, iOIL etc.
 
 

How does Synthetix work?
The process of staking and minting synthetic assets is similar in principle to how an individual would obtain an over the counter (OTC) derivative. OTC derivatives are derivatives that are bought through broker-dealer networks, rather than on stock exchanges. This means that they are inherently riskier, bearing significant counterparty risk. Thus, to mitigate this, each party is often required to put up collateral in a transaction.
In Synthetix, the act of obtaining a derivative is similar. A user first needs to lock-in or stake their collateral, SNX, into the smart contract before it issues the synthetic asset in return. However, there are a few key differences.
Firstly, Synthetix operates on a peer-to-contract model, rather than a peer-to-peer model used in traditional OTC derivatives markets. This means that Synths are traded for one another through a smart contract, rather than with a corresponding party or individual. When a trade is executed on Synthetix, the smart contract takes and burns the given Synth and mints an amount of corresponding Synth, determined by exchange rates from Chainlink’s decentralized price feeds.
Secondly, users who lock-in their collateral incur debt. Initially, the value of the debt will depend on the amount of Synths the user has minted. However, this value is non-static and will fluctuate. This is because the debt represents a portion of total network debt, whose value increases or decreases depending on the exchange rate and supply of Synths in the protocol.
For instance, if a user mints $1000 worth of sUSD and the total value of all Synths in the protocol is $1 million, then the user would hold 0.1% of total system debt. If then, the total value of Synths doubles, then the user’s debt value would also double, and vice versa.
In the event that this occurs, the user’s C-Ratio may fall below the stipulated target level of 600%. The individual would then need to either i) burn some minted Synths or ii) obtain more SNX and stake it into the protocol to mint more Synths, to bring his/her ratio back up. No rewards will be given until then. More information on debt can be found in Synthetix’s litepaper.
Finally, Synthetix generates rewards for users. As mentioned before, Synthetix offers exchange and staking rewards to users, which incentivize participation and compliance with the protocol. This is unlike traditional derivatives markets, which do not have this rewards feature.
Who governs Synthetix?
The Synthetix Foundation has been responsible for the governance of the protocol since its inception in 2017. It does this through two proposal mechanisms: i) Synthetix Improvement Proposals (SIPs) and ii) Synthetix Configuration Change Proposals (SCCPs). The former deals with proposed changes to Synthetix’s smart contract while the latter is concerned with proposed changes to values such as the C-Ratio and exchange fees. The various SIPs and SCCPs can be viewed freely at their respective links.
However, in line with moving towards greater decentralization, the Synthetix Foundation was decommissioned on 28th July 2020. In its place, three decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) were formed: i) ProtocolDAO, ii) GrantsDAO and iii) SynthetixDAO. More information on the roles and responsibilities of these DAOs can be found in Kain Warwick’s blogpost here.

63,bittorrent,"BitTorrent was initially conceived by Bram Cohen, a peer-to-peer protocol for users to transfer files around the world. The BitTorrent Token (BTT), a TRC-10 token is created on top of the TRON blockchain platform as a way to extend the capability of BitTorrent. The token is added to introduce some economics feature on BitTorrent for networking, bandwidth, and storage resources to be shared and tradeed.
Some of the other feature that BitTorrent Token (BTT) offers would be BitTorrent Speed. This is whereby BTT tokens can be big in exchange for faster download speed.

66,klay-token,"What is Klaytn? 
Klaytn is a public blockchain focused on the metaverse, gamefi, and the creator economy. Officially launched in June 2019, it is the dominant blockchain platform in South Korea and is now undergoing global business expansion from its international base in Singapore.  
These business expansion activities are supported by the Klaytn Growth Fund, which aims to grow the ecosystem built on Klaytn. The fund is managed and disbursed by Klaytn Foundation, a Singapore-based non-profit organization established in August 2021. 
 
What makes Klaytn unique? 
An end-to-end metaverse developer package:  
To simplify building for the metaverse, Klaytn offers an end-to-end metaverse package that includes customized L2 solutions, SDKs and smart contract libraries, IPFS solutions, wallets, chain explorers, oracles and bridges, as well as an ecosystem of supporting services such as stablecoin integration, NFT marketplaces, tradfi interfaces, and more. 
1-second deterministic finality:  
Klaytn utilizes an optimized version of Istanbul BFT that enables transactions to achieve absolute finality within a second, allowing for responsive user experiences and enabling use cases where near-instant and irreversible finality is necessary—such as the real-time minting of in-game item drops. 
Klaytn’s data guarantee:  
Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake blockchains exhibit probabilistic finality, which means there is a tiny chance that a transaction recorded on the chain can get reversed. This makes these blockchains unsuitable for mission-critical applications, especially if used at scale. Klaytn’s IBFT consensus algorithm guarantees that data recorded on the blockchain is correct and will never be reversed, in order to deliver the reliability and data consistency needed for large-scale applications. 
Support for Ethereum equivalence:  
Klaytn supports EVM as one of the emerging standards for the metaverse and Web3, and will be adopting the EVM specification by: 

 
 Making Klaytn’s technical stack equivalent to the Ethereum stack from an interfacing and execution perspective 
 

Making Klaytn’s technical stack equivalent to the Ethereum stack from an interfacing and execution perspective

Enabling Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and Klaytn Improvement Proposals (KIPs) to contribute to both ecosystems 
A unique governance structure: 
At the core of Klaytn’s unique take on decentralization is their Governance Council (GC). Comprising leading global enterprises and DAOs across geographies and industries, these GC members form a compact validator network that is able to deliver the benefits of a decentralized public blockchain while maintaining the performance of a permissioned blockchain. Moving forward, Klaytn aims to further increase decentralization by onboarding more DAOs to their GC to create a “DAO of DAOs”. 
Built-in scalability via service chains: 
Klaytn utilizes the hub-and-spoke model that is widely acknowledged as one of the leading scalability solutions. Klaytn’s spokes, or service chains, can be customized for specific DApp requirements such as high throughput, special node configurations, or custom security levels. In addition, support for nested service chains will provide the exponential scalability needed for metaverse-scale adoption. 
$1 billion protocol-level ecosystem fund: 
Through a combination of the initially issued reserve KLAY and on-chain tokenomics that re-invest 66% of newly-minted KLAY, Klaytn has set aside a total of $1 billion to support ecosystem growth. The funds are distributed across a range of grant and reward programs such as: 

 
 The Klaytn Improvement Reserve (KIR) for infrastructure, tools and services that improve the quality of the Klaytn network 
 
 
 The Klaytn Growth Fund (KGF) for early-stage projects with high potential for creating positive impact on Klaytn

The preferred enterprise-level blockchain: 
Klaytn is the preferred blockchain for enterprises and enterprise-level use cases, counting industry titans such as Japan’s GMO Internet Group, Indonesia’s Salim Group, and mobile gaming giants Netmarble and WeMade amongst our partners. Klaytn is also the official blockchain partner for Bank of Korea’s CBDC project, which is running off a private, modified version of Klaytn. 
 
Who are the founders of Klaytn? 
The Klaytn blockchain was developed and launched in June 2019 by GroundX, the blockchain subsidiary of Korea’s largest mobile platform, Kakao. After two years of success in Korea, the Klaytn Foundation—a non-profit entity devoted to the Klaytn network and its ecosystem—was established to begin Klaytn’s global expansion. 
Klaytn Foundation is a non-profit organization that was established to accelerate global adoption and ecosystem maturity on Klaytn. The foundation manages the Klaytn Growth Fund and operates alongside Krust, a subsidiary of internet giant Kakao Corp that invests in projects built on Klaytn. 
 
What is KLAY? 
KLAY is the native digital asset that fuels and secures the Klaytn protocol. Klaytn was launched with 10 billion KLAY issued at genesis, and there are currently 2.6 billion KLAY coins in circulation. With every new block, 9.6 KLAY will be minted and the newly issued KLAY and the sum of transaction fees used in the block (collectively called the “block reward”) will be aggregated and distributed to the following three destination accounts in accordance to the predetermined ratio: 

 
 Klaytn Governance Council Reward: 34%

67,thorchain,"What is ThorChain

ThorChain is a decentralized liquidity network with an interoperable blockchain that allows cross-chain token swaps in a non-custodial manner. It does not peg or wrap assets, but simply allows users to swap tokens across various Layer 1 blockchains. So, traders on ThorChain can seamlessly move from Bitcoin to Ethereum, to Polkadot and etc. without having to register for an exchange or go through KYC, like on CEXs. Hence, users are minimally exposed to custody and counterparty risks. 
What is RUNE
ThorChain’s consensus is proof-of-stake and built on Tendermint (Cosmos), with network validators (nodes) required to bond their native token, RUNE. RUNE has a token model that increases in value as the utilization of the network grows. This means that the more liquidity is deposited into ThorChain liquidity pools, the more valuable RUNE gets. 
RUNE is needed for two fundamental reasons: 
(i) In liquidity pools, it acts as a base pair so a 1:1 ratio of ASSET:RUNE is required (e.g. BNB.RUNE, ETH.RUNE). This is because ThorChain does not actually operate by direct asset transfer, it needs RUNE to move from one asset into another and to activate ThorChain’s Bifrost Protocol. This protocol is the bridge that enables multichain connectivity within ThorChain and requires RUNE to operate. 
(ii) RUNE is bonded as collateral by nodes for security sake following a 2:1 bond:stake ratio. Thus, RUNE is not intended to be a governance token. ThorChain will be governed more like Bitcoin, where nodes running can determine what direction it takes. This also means that ThorChain is not only limited to traders looking to trade spot tokens. It is also intended to be used by liquidity providers and node operators.
Therefore, with a 2:1 bond:stake ratio, combined with the 1:1 pool stake ratio, the amount of RUNE needed in the work is thus three times the amount of the non-RUNE assets locked. This 3:1 ratio is just the minimum value of RUNE. 
RUNE serves these five purposes
1. Liquidity: as a settlement asset 
2. Security: As a sybil-resistant security measure and a mean for driving economic behaviour 
3. Governance: To signal priority on-chain
4. Incentive: as part of incentive mechanism, RUNE is used to pay out rewards, charge fees and subsidize gas
5. Amplifier: to elevate assets that are on ThorChain
Users who utilize ThorChain’s cross-chain services between the pools will need to pay fixed network fees as well as a variable slip fee. The fee is paid due to gas fees on external services and for fast execution. Besides offering a seamless service to traders, users can also become liquidity providers on ThorChain.
Liquidity providers on ThorChain can add liquidity to various pools, which are then tied to RUNE in a separate vault. The project’s Continuous Liquidity Pool (CLP) incentivises any ThorChain participant to supply liquidity in exchange for a reward. The CLP is one of the cornerstone concepts driving the project, mainly because it is an economic paradigm that is a solution to liquidity shortage issues faced by most exchanges. ThorChain’s CLP has its own on-chain and trustless ‘basket’ of liquidity and incentivising participation in filling it, which means that thorchain’s liquidity pool is a unique exchange environment that never requires a pairing of buyer and seller to transact. The Bifrost protocol also tracks the ratio of RUNE to the asset in the CLP.
How does ThorChain differ from others?
The attraction of ThorChain is that its chain-agnostic feature allows it to swap assets on a real basis. Unlike Ren, there is no wrapped BTC (e.g. renBTC) being created. Instead, we would be able to swap real ETH for real BTC. This is a milestone, as currently the closest Bitcoin is to DeFi is in its wrapped form. Thus, ThorChain brings BTC into DeFi. 
Furthermore, as the network of new smart contract platforms grows (i.e. Solana and Polkadot), the number of chains is growing. The diversity of chains engenders the need for a trust-minimized and decentralized way to trade/swap tokens across chains, such as ThorChain. Currently, ThorChain is working on Polkadot, Solana, Monero, Cosmos (ATOM) and such, in anticipation of the launch of its mainnet. 
So, what sets ThorChain apart is its cross-chain feature – which enables any asset to be swapped, and a pool created around it. This opens a whole new world of possibilities for DeFi users and its ecosystem alike. ThorChain has seen its popularity rise as it gained the attention of Multicoin Capital, where they announced that RUNE represents one of their largest public positions, because they believe that ThorChain plays an increasingly critical role within the crypto ecosystem. Currently, the multichain testnet is available and the mainnet is yet to be launched.
How to get RUNE?
You can obtain RUNE from Uniswap, or Binance. You can also find RUNE trading on various decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges.

68,chiliz,Chiliz is a fintech platform for the sports industry to allow global fans to get closer to their favorite sports teams and clubs.
69,paxos-standard,"Pax Dollar (USDP) was created by Paxos, a financial technology company on a mission to modernize finance by mobilizing assets at the speed of the internet. Paxos was the first virtual currency company to receive a charter from the New York State Department of Financial Services. As a chartered limited purpose trust company with fiduciary powers under the Banking Law, Paxos is able to offer regulated services in the crypto-asset and virtual commodities space.
The Paxos team comes from a wide variety of backgrounds with a diverse array of experiences ranging from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. It’s led by CEO and co-founder Charles Cascarilla, who has spent his career as a customer, analyst, investor and now creator of financial technology.
Paxos describes itself as “the first regulated Trust company with blockchain expertise”, and it is using that expertise to create a modern settlement solution that can eliminate risk and simplify settlements. What many people may not know about Paxos is that it was actually founded in 2012 as Paxos Trust Company, and that for most of its life it ran the cryptocurrency exchange itBit, which is still operates. The creation of Paxos was a pivot from an exchange platform to a company focused on creating a modern settlement platform using blockchain technology.
Paxos has become the most widely adopted cryptocurrency in the fastest time frame, with support from over 20 exchanges and OTC desks in the first five weeks of its existence. It’s been picked up and listed by six of the top ten cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance, OKEx, Gate.io, ZB, KuCoin and DigiFinex. These exchanges are offering PAX as an alternative to the controversial Tether. Unlike the controversy surrounding the people who control Tether, there is no such obscurity when it comes to the people behind Paxos. The CEO and co-founder is Charles Cascarilla. He has over 15 years in financial services and has co-founded Cedar Hill asset management back in 2005. He has also worked and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs prior to that.
The Pax Dollar (USDP) is the first digital asset to be issued by a financial institution and to be fully secured by the U.S. dollar. While other similar stablecoins have existed, there has been no proof of full U.S. dollar reserves, nor have these earlier assets been issued by a financial institution. The Paxos team has been fairly clear in declaring the different base that PAX is working from. "
70,neo,"NEO is a next generation smart economy platform (formerly Antshares) and China's first open source blockchain that was founded in 2014, is often known as the “Ethereum of China”. 
What is NEO?
NEO uses a smart economy approach to implement its distributed network concept. Its main objective is to digitize assets using the decentralized network of blockchain technology and digital identity.
Neo’s main aim is to be the distributed network for “smart economy”. As their website states: ""Digital Assets + Digital Identity + Smart Contract = Smart Economy."" Neo was developed by Shanghai-based blockchain R&D company “OnChain” and funded by two crowdsales: first crowdsale on October 2015 sold 17.5 million NEO tokens for $550,000 and the second crowdsale sold the remaining 22.5 million NEO tokens for $4.5 million.
So why NEO?
Asset digitization and identity on the NEO platform essentially creates a novel way for asset registration, issuance, and circulation. This means that tangible assets like real estate, company shares or even fiat money can be digitized and traded on the NEO network, thus giving rise to a whole new economy.
Its digital identity system allows for integration between the platform and the real world economy. It has custom digital identity standards that enable the creation of electronic identity data for individuals, organizations and even entities. These electronic systems use multi-layered authentication models that include facial and voice recognition as well as fingerprints.
All digital assets on the platform enjoy legal protection thanks to the use of digital certificates on its public blockchain. This, in turn, guarantees trust as the system offers an indelible and unalterable record of all entities’ holdings."

72,huobi-token,"Huobi, the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, recently announced and launched a new currency. The Huobi Token (HT) rewards exchange users for their loyalty with lowered transaction fees while also carrying its own value in tradable pairs against popular currencies. The hope was to bring greater value to Huobi’s millions of users, mostly located in Asian countries. The launch of the Huobi Token follows in the footsteps of other loyalty-building tokens that other exchanges have launched. The first and most successful of these tokens has been Binance Coin (BNB). The creation of BNB secured Binance’s place as the world’s leading exchange. It offered discounted trading fees in exchange for customer loyalty, primarily functioning as a loyalty rewards system.
Huobi officially announced its intentions to launch a new token on January 22, 2018. Over the course of 15 days, Huobi would distribute 300 million HT (60% of the total supply) to its pro users who purchased a discounted service package. Each morning, a new batch of HT would become available on a first come, first served basis. Huobi declared this token distribution scheme, “not an ICO,” due to the nature of the offering. Users are buying a specific service package, part of which includes HT that give a discount toward trading fees. The exchange launched the Huobi Token as part of an overall strategy to recover its user base after tightening regulations in China severely restricted cryptocurrency trading. In an interview with CoinDesk, Leon Li, Huobi’s founder, revealed that Chinese rule changes had decimated the trading volume on Huobi by 95% between September 15 and November 1, 2017.
The HT token distribution began on January 24 and wrapped up on February 7, 2018. Each day of the distribution, millions of tokens sold out in mere minutes after going on sale. At that point, 300 million HT had been distributed to Huobi Pro members who bought packages. That’s 60% of the total supply currently in public circulation. Another 200 million HT, 40% of the total supply, was set aside. 20% goes toward user rewards and platform operation. The other 20% is vested for four years and constitutes the team reward.
Huobi isn’t the first exchange to issue its own token. Binance (BNB), Bibox (BIX), KuCoin (KCS) and Coss (COSS) have all issued their own tokens as well."

77,pancakeswap-token,"What is CAKE?
CAKE is the governance token for PancakeSwap.
The supply of CAKE is not hard-capped. Theoretically, CAKE’s supply is unlimited. The team is looking into conducting regular token burns to make deflation higher than emission. For example, the team will burn 10% of the CAKE collected on lottery tickets and burn half of the fund raised through Initial Farm Offerings (IFO). 
How to obtain CAKE?
You can purchase CAKE from exchanges such as PancakeSwap or Binance. You can find CAKE trading on various centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges. 
What is PancakeSwap?

PancakeSwap is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) built on top of Binance Smart Chain (BSC). It is the biggest Automated Market Maker (AMM) based exchange in BSC. 
Binance Smart Chain has much lower transaction fees than Ethereum.
How to start using Pancakeswap?
Users will need to connect to the Binance Smart Chain in order to access Pancakeswap. It is possible to do so through Metamask or Binance Chain Wallet. Users will have to customize their Metamask with the following details after choosing custom RPC from the network’s option.
Binance operates two different chains:

 
 Binance Chain - BEP 2
 
 
 Binance Smart Chain (BSC) - BEP 20
 

Binance Chain - BEP 2
Binance Smart Chain (BSC) - BEP 20
Binance DEX is the primary decentralized app operating on Binance Chain. Most other projects are building on the Binance Smart Chain. The easiest way to convert any assets to its BEP 20 representation is through the Binance exchange. 
For example, after depositing Bitcoin to Binance Exchange, users can choose to withdraw it in the forms of ERC 20 (ETH), BEP 2 (Binance Chain), BEP 20 (BSC), and BTC’s native chain. Choose BEP 20 if you would like to have the asset interact with PancakeSwap. 
An alternative is through Binance Bridge, where users can swap the assets cross-chain from any L1 chain to BSC. 
Users will need to have BNB to pay for any transaction fee on Binance Smart Chain, similar to how users will need ETH to pay for transaction fees on Ethereum.
What are the fees incurred from using PancakeSwap?
A token swap (trade) on the exchange will incur a 0.2% trading fee, broken down as follow: 

 
 0.17% - Returned to liquidity pools in the form of a fee reward for liquidity providers.
 
 
 0.03% - Sent to the PancakeSwap Treasury.
 

0.17% - Returned to liquidity pools in the form of a fee reward for liquidity providers.
0.03% - Sent to the PancakeSwap Treasury.
How to provide liquidity in PancakeSwap?
Like Uniswap, users will have to add two tokens into the Liquidity Pool in the ratio of 1:1. Users will receive FLIP tokens - PancakeSwap’s version of liquidity provider tokens - to represent their stake in the pool. 
Like Sushiswap, PancakeSwap has a yield farming program where users can stake their LP tokens to earn CAKE rewards. 
What are Syrup Pools?
Syrup Pools allow Binance Smart Chain projects to bootstrap adoption by distributing a portion of their tokens to CAKE token holders. In exchange for that, projects will receive default listing on the PancakeSwap interface, obtaining priority promotion on the exchange by ranking temporarily first in the token selection list.
What is the Cake Lottery?
One lottery ticket cost 10 CAKE. Users will receive a random four-digit combination with each digit between 1-14, e.g., “1-9-3-2”. There is no limit on how many tickets users can buy. 
The first prize winner will receive half of the lottery pool by matching the four winning numbers. Matching two and three numbers will also be entitled to prizes. Do find an example below: 
For more details, please refer to the official Pancakeswap documentation.
What is Initial Farm Offering (IFO)?
Projects can launch new tokens by raising funds through the CAKE-BNB LP tokens. The project gets BNB tokens, PancakeSwap burns CAKE tokens, and users get the project’s tokens. CAKE tokens equating to half of the total funds raised will be burned forever. If $1,000,000 is raised, then $500,000 worth of CAKE tokens will be burned.

78,basic-attention-token,"
What is Basic Attention Token?
A very common question when it comes to Basic Attention Token (BAT) is: “Why would Brave Browser need a token (BAT) for this?”. And the answer lies within Brave’s unusual, yet respectful approach to digital advertising. Brave’s advertisements are privacy centric (does not track the user), and are opt-in only (you only see it if you choose to). 
And that’s where the Basic Attention Token (BAT) comes into play. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, and embedded into the Brave browser - it is an incentive token built into the browser to reward all players in the ecosystem - the user, advertiser and publisher.
Who created Basic Attention Token?
Basic Attention Token (BAT) is a cryptocurrency issued by Brave Inc. for their Brave Web Browser.
Brave Web Browser was first founded in 2015 by web pioneer Brendan Eich (creator of JavaScript and former CEO of Mozilla Corporation) and CTO Brian Bondy. Following that, Brave browser launched in 2016 with its key feature of ad and tracker blocking.
The Basic Attention Token was co-created by Eich and Bondy. The utility token was integrated into the browser and launched officially on May 31, 2017; it managed to raise $35 million.
Why is Brave Browser interesting?
Brave browser’s value proposition is its privacy-centric advertisements which does not track users, and that they are only opt-in. As users browse the web and opt into advertisements on Brave, they are rewarded with BAT for their attention. Publishers also receive a share of the BAT if they are able to retain quality users, while advertisers get better returns on their advertising funds by being able to reach quality audiences who are willing to pay attention to ads.
Users who have BAT can also choose to automatically contribute their BAT tokens to publishers based on their attention spent on the website or to manually tip them. Some known publishers who have signed up with Brave include The Washington Post, Vice, The Guardian, and more. 
Where to buy or sell Basic Attention Token (BAT)?

Do bear in mind that if you would like to withdraw BAT, you will need to complete the “Know Your Customer” (KYC) procedure with Uphold. Uphold is a partner custody service of Brave that acts as your BAT token wallet. However, should you choose to only contribute your BAT to publishers, KYC is not necessary.
Where can I spend or use Basic Attention Token (BAT)?
The Basic Attention Token is currently native to the Brave browser. As you are using Brave, you can choose to stream BAT tokens to publishers automatically or to tip your favourite publisher that you wish to support through Brave Rewards. 
Brave Rewards lets you anonymously contribute to the sites you visit. In addition, your browser tallies the attention you spend on the sites you visit and divides up a monthly BAT contribution among sites based on your attention. Nobody will know which sites you visit or support — including the creators at Brave Software.
The other use case for BAT is that you can collateralize it on Maker in order to mint new supply of DAI. This is a newly introduced feature by Maker as part of their Multi-Collateral Dai effort.
How to mine Basic Attention Token?
Unfortunately, BAT is non-mineable. This is because all the BAT that will exist has already been created during its ICO time. BAT can only be earned at the moment, as explained earlier.
What are the benefits of Basic Attention Token?
BAT is challenging the status quo by offering an alternative solution to paid advertising. In an online world where cookies track your browsing behaviour and your privacy compromised all in the name of optimizing ads revenue. BAT is a refreshing approach that aims to bring the power back to users while at the same time benefit publishers accordingly.
Digital advertising will be disrupted in years to come as more and more internet consumers become more aware of protecting their privacy. Basic Attention Token may play a central role in terms of filling the revenue gap as users shy away from selling their privacy to advertising companies.
Can I Earn more BAT by holding it?
Yes, you can earn BAT by depositing it into various platforms. Hop on over to this page and start earning!

79,zilliqa,"What is Zilliqa (ZIL)
Zilliqa (ZIL) is a token developed in the year 2017. Zilliqa is mainly based on the concept of Sharding and primarily aims at improving the scalability of the cryptocurrency networks as in case of Bitcoin or Ethereum. The white paper mentions that the transactions speed would be approximately a thousand times more than that of Ethereum network. Ziliqa is fast, secured and decentralized. Zilliqa’s high throughput means that you can focus on developing your ideas without worrying about network congestion, high transaction fees or security which are the key issues with legacy blockchain platforms.
Zilliqa's Sharding Mechanism
Zilliqa network uses a concept called Sharding where the transactions are grouped into smaller groups and divided among the miners for the parallel transactional verification. Developing smaller groups for transactional verification means the Consensus can be reached faster and hence a higher number of transactions can be processed in a given time frame. The capacity of the network linearly increases in other cryptocurrencies as the number of people joins the network, but in this case, the capacity is increased at a higher variable rate than the number of members joining the network.
By incorporating the Sharding Technology, it can completely revolutionize the smart contract functionality too. Ziliqa has few pros as it has a great new technology. Zilliqa is the first platform to use sharding technology. This puts it ahead of the rest of the market. It’s a completely new kind of blockchain designed to solve the problem of scalability. Third-generation platforms like Zilliqa could be the big winners in the future of cryptocurrency.
Ziliqa has a strong community. The platform has a lot of fans. The Zilliqa ICO only happened because there was so much demand for it. The Zilliqa ICO also shows that the crypto community is ready to see blockchain technology move to the next phase of its development.

82,enjincoin,"What is Enjin Coin?
Enjin Coin is a cryptocurrency for virtual goods created by Enjin. Enjin is the “largest gaming community platform online” with over 250,000 gaming communities and 18.7 million registered gamers. The Enjin team is designing the coin completely around gaming with the goal of it being the most usable cryptocurrency for the industry. The project includes the Enjin Coin as well as a suite of software development kits (SDKs) that developers can integrate into their games and communities. Bringing blockchain to gaming helps to reduce the high fees and fraud that’s prevalent in the transfer of virtual goods.
Enjin Coin is an ERC20 token built on the Ethereum network. With that, the project not only acts as a cryptocurrency but also has smart contract capabilities. It’s also one of the first projects testing the Raiden Network, Ethereum’s version of the Lightning Network. The Enjin Coin platform provides a laundry list of features through its public API and SDKs. To keep things brief, though, we’ll only be discussing a few of the major ones in this article. The largest value Enjin Coin brings to the gaming community is in its creation and management of virtual goods. Developers on each platform can easily create a currency unique to their community that’s backed by Enjin Coin as the parent currency. This gives the coins all the benefits of the blockchain (speed, cost, security, etc…) while still staying customized to their respective platforms.
Enjin, the company behind Enjin Coin, is the largest online gaming community creation platform. Started in 2009, the company receives 60 million views per month and transacts millions of U.S. dollars each month in their community stores. The team is deploying Enjin Coin across the entire Enjin CMS platform – over 250,000 gaming websites. Advisors to the project consist of Anthony Diiorio (Ethereum co-founder) and Pat LaBine (previous producer and technical director at Bioware). Enjin has also formed partnerships with Unity, PC Gamer, and NRG eSports. The team held a successful ICO in late 2017 in which they raised ~$35 million between the private and public rounds. Although it’s still a young project, the team spent the last quarter of 2017 building the Platform API, Mobile Smart Wallet, and a Java SDK alongside creating a Minecraft plugin. They’ve got plenty in store for 2018, but the highlights include various platform plugins, the Efinity release, and numerous other SDKs.
Enjin also features a tool known as TopLists, which allow users to rank games, servers, teams and any other item. TopLists will be deployed as a decentralized smart contract with functionalities that will allow for market bidding or democratic voting. List creators are incentivized to promote and market their list because these creators will receive tokens when users perform tasks such as voting on their list. Enjin Coin is an ambitious project that aims to integrate online virtual gaming with decentralized technologies. Enjin Coin project promises a lot, and it is only with the passage of time that we will able to see if it can deliver on those promises.

83,amp-token,"What is Amp?
Amp is described as the new digital collateral token offering instant, verifiable assurances for any kind of value transfer. Using Amp, networks like Flexa can quickly and irreversibly secure transactions for a wide variety of asset-related use cases.
How does Amp work?
Amp claims to offer a straightforward but versatile interface for verifiable collateralization through a system of collateral partitions and collateral managers. Where collateral partitions can be designated to collateralize any account, application, or even transaction, and carry balances which are directly verifiable on the Ethereum blockchain, collateral managers are smart contracts that can lock, release, and redirect collateral in these partitions as needed in order to support value transfer activities. Amp supports a wide variety of use cases for collateralization, and also introduces the concept of predefined partition strategies, which can enable special capabilities such as collateral models through which tokens can be staked without ever leaving their original address."

What is LRC?
LRC is the governance token for Loopring. 
How to obtain LRC?
You can purchase LRC from exchanges such as Uniswap or Binance. You can find LRC trading on various centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges. 
What is Loopring?
Loopring is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) built on an Ethereum Layer-2 (L2) solution called zkRollup. It has both Automated Market Maker (AMM)-based and orderbook-based exchanges. 
zkRollup is an Ethereum L2 scaling solution that migrates computations off the blockchain. Loopring protocol only uses the underlying Ethereum blockchain as a data layer and a verification layer. As a result, Loopring's throughput is as high as 2,025 trades per second compared to Ethereum’s current throughput of 15 transactions per second. The result is that the cost per trade settlement is as small as $0.00015.
Loopring's performance is sufficient for professional traders and market makers to deploy algorithmic strategies and other automated trading bots. This was not previously possible on any DEX as it was prohibitively slow and expensive. By building on top of Loopring 3.0, orderbook-based DEXs can be commercially viable for the first time. Loopring expects non-custodial exchanges can begin to outcompete and displace many centralized counterparts.
How to use the Loopring DEX?
Loopring DEX is not composable with other L1 dapps and L2 dapps that are not built on zkRollup. As such, users will have to deposit their assets to the L2 chain before trading. If users want to use other Ethereum applications, they will have to withdraw from the L2 chain back to the Ethereum main chain, incurring significant gas fees. Due to these limitations, Loopring DEX has yet to gain significant traction. 
What are the fees incurred from using Loopring DEX?
AMM
There is a 0.25% fee for swaps done on Loopring’s L2 AMM, including the gas fee.

 
 0.15% of this fee goes to liquidity providers (LPs) for the relevant pool. These are the people who provide the assets in the pool for users to swap.
 
 
 0.1% is the L2 transaction fee, paid to the Loopring relayer so the zkRollup can run.
 

0.15% of this fee goes to liquidity providers (LPs) for the relevant pool. These are the people who provide the assets in the pool for users to swap.
0.1% is the L2 transaction fee, paid to the Loopring relayer so the zkRollup can run.
It is from this L2 fee of 0.1% that the protocol fee is paid. So, 0.1% * 20% protocol percentage = 0.02% protocol fee from AMM swaps.
Orderbook
Trading fees on the orderbook follow a maker-taker model.

 
 Taker fees are 0.25% (or lower for VIP tiers). Takers are users who take liquidity from the orderbook (they are filled immediately).
 
 
 Maker fees are -0.02% (negative 2 bps). Makers are users who add liquidity to the orderbook (their orders rest on the book for some time). Makers earn rebates for their service of providing liquidity, just like LPs earn in the AMM pools. Makers earn 2 bps (0.02%) on all of their filled orders.
 
 
 On stablecoin vs stablecoin pairs, the taker fee is 0.04%, and the maker fee is still -0.02%.

On stablecoin vs stablecoin pairs, the taker fee is 0.04%, and the maker fee is still -0.02%.
Protocol fees are once again 20% of the L2 fee (removing the liquidity incentive for makers first). So, protocol percentage = (0.25% - 0.02%) * 20% = 0.046% protocol fee from orderbook trading and 0.004% on stablecoin-stablecoin orderbook trading.
Transfers
There are small fixed fees for L2 transfers for users, currently $0.05. The protocol fee is once again 20% of the relayer’s fee, so $0.01.
Summary — the current fees earned by the protocol are 

 
 0.020% on AMM swaps
 
 
 0.046% on orderbook trades
 
 
 0.004% on stablecoin-stablecoin trades
 
 
 $0.01 on transfers
 

0.020% on AMM swaps
0.046% on orderbook trades
0.004% on stablecoin-stablecoin trades
$0.01 on transfers
Protocol fees are paid to 3 types of participants: 
a) Liquidity Providers (liquidity mining incentives) - 80% 
b) Insurers - 10%
c) Loopring DAO - 10%
Protocol fees accrued in tokens other than LRC and ETH will be sold for and distributed in LRC or ETH monthly.

90,kava,"
What Is Kava (KAVA)?
Kava is a Layer-1 blockchain that combines the speed and interoperability of Cosmos with the developer power of Ethereum. 
 
The Kava Network uses a developer-optimized co-chain architecture. The Ethereum Co-Chain enables support for EVM smart contracts while the Cosmos Co-Chain enables the lightning-fast Tendermint consensus engine and the Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC). 
The two co-chains are connected by a translator module that enables them to interoperate seamlessly, bringing the two most used blockchain development environments together in a single, scalable network.
The Kava Network features a native governance and utility token, KAVA, that can be staked by validators or delegated to validator nodes. Stakers and delegators earn 37.5% of all KAVA emissions as a reward for securing the network. Kava stakers also have voting rights in network governance proposals.
What Makes Kava Unique?
The Kava Network utilizes a developer-optimized co-chain architecture that delivers the development power of Ethereum with the speed, interoperability, and low transaction fees of Cosmos in a single network.
The Kava Network empowers developers with:

 
 Flexible Deployment: Developers can build and deploy on either of the two most used permissionless execution environments in the world using the EVM-compatible Ethereum Co-Chain or the Cosmos Co-Chain.
 
 
 On-Chain Incentives: A transparent and decentralized on-chain incentive model ensures that the best developers and projects in every Web3 vertical (including DeFi, GameFi, and NFTs) are rewarded for their contributions with a proportional share of the value and governance of the network.
 
 
 Seamless Interoperability: Developers can deploy Solidity smart contracts that interoperate seamlessly with Cosmos SDK protocols in the same network, connecting their project to every major asset and millions of users.

Where Can You Buy Kava (KAVA)?
Users can trade KAVA tokens on over a dozen exchanges. There are now many KAVA trading pairs available, the most popular of which include: KAVA/USDT, KAVA/BTC, and KAVA/BNB.
As of March 2022, Binance is the most liquid exchange for KAVA tokens, whereas Kraken is the only exchange to offer KAVA/EUR and KAVA/USD trading pairs. 
How Is the Kava Network Secured?
Kava is built on Cosmos and uses a Tendermint-based proof-of-stake (POS) consensus mechanism to ensure the integrity of the network.
The Kava Network uses a network of validator nodes for confirming transactions. These validator nodes must put up collateral to take up the duty of validating transactions. If validators misbehave or fail to meet rigorous minimum requirements, their stake will be penalized — thereby incentivizing validators to remain honest and efficient.
Kava holders can run a staking node to earn KAVA rewards directly from the protocol. However, only the top 100 Kava nodes (also known as validators) are eligible to receive these rewards. Beyond this, KAVA holders can stake their tokens on various compatible exchange platforms, like Binance, Kraken, Huobi Pool, and in wallets like Trust Wallet, Cosmostation Wallet, and Keplr.
Multiple independent blockchains and crypto security firms have audited Kava’s smart contracts, including CertiK, B-Harvest, and Quantstamp. To date, no vulnerabilities have been found.
Kava Governance
The KavaDAO is a fully decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governing the Kava Network. KAVA stakers and validators secure and run the network; thus, their responsibility is to table and vote on proposals that affect the Kava Network.
These changes can take the form of smart contract modifications, adjustments to the global debt limit, the addition or removal of collateral assets, among other considerations. 

Voting can be conducted either directly or delegated to validators. The numerous implemented and proposed changes are accessible via Kava’s governance page.

91,bitcoin-gold,"Bitcoin Gold hopes to change the paradigm around mining on the Bitcoin blockchain. According to the founders, the Bitcoin blockchain has become too centralized. Large companies with huge banks of mining computers now mine the vast majority of Bitcoin. For the founders of Bitcoin Gold, having large companies control the Bitcoin network defeats the purpose of a decentralized ledger and peer-to-peer currencies. In response, they’ve initialized the Bitcoin Gold project. It’s an alternate fork of the Bitcoin blockchain that implements changes that make mining more equitable.
The goal of Bitcoin Gold is to create a network where anyone can become a miner with only basic hardware. As a result, Bitcoin Gold mining would be spread among many miners, instead of a few large companies.There have several features such as decentralization. Bitcoin Gold decentralizes mining by adopting a PoW algorithm, Equihash-BTG, which cannot be run on the specialty equipment used for Bitcoin mining (ASIC miners.) This gives ordinary users a fair opportunity to mine with common GPUs. Besides, there have fair distribution. Hard forking Bitcoin’s blockchain fairly and efficiently distributes 16.5 million BTG immediately to people all over the world who have interest in cryptos. 
Other methods, such as creating coins with a new genesis block, concentrate ownership within a small group. There also have a replay protection. To ensure the safety of the Bitcoin ecosystem, Bitcoin Gold has implemented full replay protection and unique wallet addresses, essential features that protect users and their coins from several kinds of accidents and malicious threats. Most new mineable cryptocurrencies involve ASIC-resistant hashing algorithms, and it’s becoming something of an industry standard to promote decentralization. In that respect, Bitcoin Gold holds a lot to be excited about. At its core, it’s about transitioning the Bitcoin network to more decentralized mining.
However, as we saw above, there’s not much evidence that the current Bitcoin mining system is broken. There have been some small complaints, and it’s not ideal that the network is so centralized. Nevertheless, miners on Bitcoin have a lot to lose if they wield their power too aggressively. There are also new entrants to the Bitcoin mining community that are decentralizing control from a few key ASIC farms. The general consensus from Bitcoin experts is there’s not enough new in Bitcoin Gold to warrant an independent investment. While it certainly doesn’t hurt to hold onto your free BTG that you receive as a result of the fork (if you owned Bitcoin before Oct 24), wait until the dust settles before deciding whether to buy more."""

Kusama is a public blockchain network that is running the exact same codebase as Polkadot. It is aimed to be a canary build for the Polkadot network which is an experimental and development environment for new features that will eventually be deployed to Polkadot. Because of the experimental nature of Kusama, the developmental speed is much faster and it has seen significant traction since launched in 2019.
Notable projects that have expressed interest to deploy on the Polkadot network are also treating Kusama as an experimental sister chain. For example, the Acala DeFi network which was planned to be rolled out on Polkadot, will begin deploying the Karura network on Kusama first.
Who created Kusama?
Founders of the project include team members of Polkadot such as Gavin Wood (whom used to found Ethereum with Vitalik Buterin and team), Peter Czaban, and Robert Habermeier. 
What is the Kusama Parachain Slot Auction?
The Kusama network consists of a multi chain architecture. These chains (also called parachains) are interconnected with each other within the network through leasing a slot on the Relay Chain. In order for a chain to obtain a slot, projects will need to bid for it via an auction. The Parachain Slot Auction is conducted in order to allocated slots to the projects that have the most KSM bonded coins.
In order to raise enough KSM to secure a slot, projects may opt for a parachain loan offering to raise KSM from the public. Holders will need to bond and lock their KSM coins with the project that they are interested to support with the hope that the project will secure a slot and go live with the network. As auction participants will be taking risks of locking up their KSM, projects would typically offer some sort of reward incentives, one option would be for them to offer their own native token should the network launches.
For example, Karura is offering 12 KAR tokens for every 1 KSM that is contributed to their loan offering.
Projects should opt to using the Kusama built-in crowdloan module when confucting the loan offering to ensure users funds are protected and remains locked for the purpose of the slot lease.
The Kusama auction guide is a great place to read more about the entire mechanism.
How can I participate in a Kusama parachain auction?
Users can choose to participate in the parachain auction in the form of a crowdloan. This can be done through a centralized exchange or decentralized services. They would also need to hold some KSM coins.
Exchanges such as Kraken, Kucoin, and Okex supports parachain auctions directly within their exchange.
For a decentralized options, users can consider Bounce, Math Wallet, or interacting with the Polkadot.js on the project website directly.
Where can I find all the projects that are participating in the auction and offering a crowdloan?

What is CRV?
CRV is the governance token for Curve Finance. It implemented a complex time-based staking system to exchange CRV into veCRV, where veCRV is an internal token intended for governance purpose and has a right to claim the cash flows generated by the protocol. 
1 CRV locked for 4 years = 1veCRV
1 CRV locked for 3 years = 0.75veCRV
1 CRV locked for 2 years = 0.50veCRV
1 CRV locked for 1 year = 0.25veCRV
Curve Finance conducted one of the biggest retroactive token airdrops on 14 August 2020 to reward early users, with a vesting period up to 4 years. It intends to have yield farming for all of its pool, with the reward weightage voted by the veCRV holders. 
Yield Farming refers to the activity of depositing and locking capital in a DeFi Protocol for the reward of the protocol’s native tokens. DeFi protocols need to bootstrap capital to provide liquidity for exchanges, lend to borrowers, underwrite insurance risk, etc. It acts as an incentive to attract users to use the protocol while generating hype, giving out part of its native tokens. 
Yield farmers will have to constantly monitor their veCRV power to get the maximum payout from the yield farming exercise as veCRV decays with time. There is a calculator built that shows this in detail. For further information do refer to the official documentation.
 
How to obtain CRV?
CRV can be obtained by buying them from exchanges such as Sushiswap or Binance. You can find CRV trading on various centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges. 
What is Curve Finance?
Similar to Uniswap, Curve Finance is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) based Decentralised Exchange (DEX). Unlike Uniswap, its main focus is only to swap between assets that are supposed to have the same value. This is useful in the DeFi ecosystem as there are plenty of wrapped tokens and synthetic tokens that aim to mimic the price of the real underlying asset. 
For example, one of the biggest pools is 3CRV, which is a stablecoin pool consisting of DAI, USDT, and USDC. Their ratio in the pool will be based on the supply and demand of the market. Depositing a coin with a lesser ratio will yield the user a higher percentage of the pool. As such when the ratio is heavily tilted to one of the coins, it may serve as a good chance to arbitrage.
Curve Finance also supports yield-bearing tokens. For example, it collaborated with Yearn Finance to release yUSD pools that consisted of yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDC and yTUSD. Users that participated in this pool will not only have yield from the underlying yield-bearing tokens, but also the swap fees generated by the Curve pool. Including the yield farming rewards in terms of CRV tokens, liquidity providers of the pool actually have three sources of yield. 
What is metapool?
To promote the liquidity of more obscure tokens, Curve introduced the concept of base and meta pools. Metapools allow for one token to seemingly trade with another underlying base pool. This means we could create for example the following pool: [GUSD, [3CRV]].
In this example users could seamlessly trade GUSD between the three coins in the 3CRV (DAI/USDC/USDT). This is helpful in multiple ways:

 
 Prevents diluting existing pools
 
 
 Allows Curve to list less liquid assets
 
 
 More volume and more trading fees for the DAO
 

Prevents diluting existing pools
Allows Curve to list less liquid assets
More volume and more trading fees for the DAO
The Metapool in question would take GUSD and 3CRV LP tokens. This means that liquidity providers of the 3CRV pool who do not provide liquidity in the GUSD Metapool are shielded from systemic risks from the Metapool.
The similar base pool for BTC is sBTC Curve, consisting of wBTC, renBTC and sBTC.
What is the pool factory?
In collaboration with Yearn Finance, Curve has developed a pool factory, a way for anyone to deploy a Curve Metapool with the 3CRV or sBTC Pool.
Before this, only the Curve DAO can deploy a new pool. Now, anyone can deploy a pool for stable or algo coins as well as a tokenized Bitcoin in a few clicks.
There are a few parameters to be set:

Pools created through pool factory has a few characteristics:

 
 It is not possible to destroy the Curve pools once deployed.
 
 
 Assets listed are not vetted by the Curve DAO, so users need to do their own research when trading those assets. This includes verifying the token addresses.
 
 
 The only admin change that can be made by the Curve DAO is ramping the A (amplification) parameter
 
 
 Tokens with more than 18 decimals are not supported
 
 
 Initial liquidity have to be seeded by the deployer

Other than USD and BTC, are other assets supported?
Curve Finance just launched the ETH and EUR pools, with support for more assets in the development pipeline. 
ETH: sETH[ ETH, sETH], and stETH [ETH, stETH].
EUR: eurs[eurs, seur]
What are the benefits of providing liquidity to Curve pools?
As an example, let's look at stETH pool that provides four sources of yield.
This can be viewed at the main page of Curve Finance. Looking at the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) figures, it shows that the Liquidity Providers (LPs) can roughly expect 

 
 3.33% APY from trading fees
 
 
 7.40% APY from LDO token rewards
 
 
 0.15% to 0.37% CRV token rewards (based on amount of veCRV locked). 
 
 
 What is not shown here is the staking yield available for stETH. 
 

3.33% APY from trading fees
7.40% APY from LDO token rewards
0.15% to 0.37% CRV token rewards (based on amount of veCRV locked). 
What is not shown here is the staking yield available for stETH. 
As of January 2021, the total yield would be in the range of 49%-57% APY. The exact APY hinges on the weekly gauge weight votes, veCRV boost, and the LDO rewards that are expected to only last for 1 month starting from 13 Jan 2021.
The LDO and CRV tokens will have to be manually claimed and sold to ETH if the users only want to increase their ETH holdings, as such, it is simpler to use yield farming aggregators such as Yearn Finance that can do that automatically. 
How to provide liquidity to Curve pools?
Using the same example as above, after clicking the pool and going to the deposit tab, users are able to see the information about the selected pool.
As shown, the ratio of the pool is now ETH (44.96%) and stETH(55.04%). Therefore, depositing ETH will yield a bonus pricing of 0.2%. 
If users want to avoid any bonus or slippage in pricing, choose the ‘Add all coins in a balanced proportion’ option. 
Stake in gauge basically means staking to earn the yield farming rewards of CRV tokens. 
What is gauge weight?
Gauge weight refers to the daily CRV rewards a pool receives. The following graph can be found at the “Gauge weight vote” tab under the Curve DAO. 
From the graph we can see that the stETH pool is only expected to have 1.37% of the daily CRV rewards. The weights shown above are the voting result by the veCRV holders conducted every week.
How to maximise the APY through vote locking veCRV?
Using the same stETH vault above, let's look at how to maximise the CRV rewards from the yield farming activity. A certain amount of veCRV is required to boost the CRV rewards up to max 2.5x. Below is the interface of the calculator.
From the picture above it can be seen that locking 1000 CRV for two years will yield 500 veCRV and is expected to have a 1.99x boost on 1 ETH worth of assets in the stETH pool. If users already have assets in the pool, click the “Use existing deposit” option. 
To achieve the maximum boost of 2.5x, users will need 760.84 veCRV. Users can lock 1,521.68 CRV for two years to achieve this. 
The voting power applies to all pools the users have but may produce different boosts based on how much liquidity users are providing and how much total liquidity the pool has. veCRV decreases over time but the boost will only be updated at certain checkpoints like withdrawing, depositing into a pool, or claiming CRV rewards. Constant monitoring is required to maintain max boost. 
What are the fees to use Curve Finance?
Most swaps on Curve cost 0.04% in fees. 50% of the fees go to veCRV holders and 50% of the fees go to Liquidity Providers (LPs). Pools that are launched through the pool factory can support up to 1% in fees. For up to date information, go to the deposit page of the selected pool like shown above where the total fee and admin fee (fees earned by veCRV holders) are shown.

It was one of the first non-turing complete chains to feature user-defined tokens (called mosaics), namespaces, multisignature accounts, and a P2P reputation system based on EigenTrust++. Its most notable contribution, however, was the PoI consensus mechanism which sought to reward on-chain activity and deter the concentration of wealth commonly associated with proof-of-stake. Its client, NIS, is written in Java. Today, NEM remains a highly-traded cryptocurrency. Current development is centered around NEM's merge with another blockchain platform: Symbol."
103,1inch,"What is 1inch Network?
1inch Network is a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator to help users discover the best trade prices for tokens. Instead of swapping tokens from a single liquidity pool of a DEX, 1inch will aggregate across different pools and suggest the most efficient way to trade tokens.

Why use 1inch?
If you are a trader trading large amount of tokens, you may not be aware of all the availability liquidity across different DEXes in order to get the best price quote. Price quote offered by DEX fluctuates according to the liquidity pool at any given time. Also, when you are trading large size, every percentage of savings can be magnified with an optimal trading path. 1inch aims to solve all that in a single user friendly interface.
What is Pathfinder?
Pathfinder is the discovery and routing algorithm developed by the 1inch team. It is the algorithm the powers the backend to finding the most efficient route to swap a token. For example, if a user wants to sell ETH for WBTC, Pathfinder will explore all DEXes such as Uniswap, Curve, Balancer, DODO, Sushiswap, and more. The result is a recommended route that optimizes fees and liquidity in order to give users the best rate. Users no longer need to check each individual services in order to find the best price.
Who are the creators of 1inch?
1inch was founded by Sergej Kunz (CEO) and Anton Bukov (CTO). The idea for 1inch was developed at a hackathon in just over 60 hours at New York City. Fast forward today, it is one of the fastest growing DeFi product.

111,gnosis,"
GnosisDAO builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem.
In November 2021, both the xDAI and GnosisDAO community voted to combine their vibrant ecosystems to create the Gnosis Chain: An Ethereum forerunner-companion that addresses scaling issues through solid engineering. Gnosis Chain is the associated execution-layer EVM chain for stable transactions. It uses the xDai token and includes a wide-ranging group of projects and users.
The Gnosis mission has always been centered on experimentation and building decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem. When Gnosis was founded in 2015, it focused on building prediction markets to enable worldwide access to accurate information. While creating the prediction market platform, it became clear that Gnosis needed to build the infrastructure required to support it. Gnosis Safe, for example, was born of necessity.
As a DAO, Gnosis uses the products that it creates to transparently guide decisions on the development, support, and governance of its ecosystem.
Gnosis Safe (multisig and programmable account), Cow Protocol (formerly CowSwap and Gnosis Protocol), Conditional Tokens (prediction markets), Gnosis Auction, and Zodiac (standard and tooling for composable DAOs) are all products incubated by Gnosis. Their success can be attributed to the recent spin-out of Cow Protocol and the formation of SafeDAO. By combining needs-driven development with deep technical expertise, Gnosis has built the decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem.
What is Gnosis Token?
The Gnosis token, GNO, is an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token sold during the Gnosis ICO. Gnosis raised funds through its utility token GNO in 2017. The total GNO supply is 10 Million. The Gnosis ICO was held on 24 April 2017, in which ~5% of the total supply was sold. Gnosis raised the equivalent of 12.5 Million USD (250 000 ETH). Using a Dutch auction, the final price of GNO arrived at approximately 29.84 USD. 
What is Gnosis?
Gnosis was founded in 2015 by Martin Köppelmann and Stefan George as part of ConsenSys, the globally leading Ethereum venture production studio. Gnosis was the first team to launch a live application on Ethereum in 2016, and four years later, Gnosis offers three leading product lines (conditional tokens for prediction markets, Gnosis Protocol, DEX, Gnosis Safe Multisig fund management platform) that allow you to securely create, trade, and hold digital assets. 
Gnosis additionally supports infrastructure required to make their mission thrive, including initiatives such as:

 
 Maintaining OpenEthereum, the fast, light, and robust client for Ethereum;
 
 
 Hosting DappCon, a nonprofit conference for the Ethereum ecosystem; 
 
 
 Founding and running Full Node, a co-working space for decentralized technology initiatives to work and collaborate;
 
 
 Investing in early stage projects via the Gnosis Ecosystem Fund;

Investing in early stage projects via the Gnosis Ecosystem Fund;
In summary, Gnosis's mission is to build new market mechanisms for decentralized finance. Each product has complementary tokenomics designed to bring value to the Gnosis utility token: GNO.
What is the Gnosis Conditional Tokens Framework? 
Gnosis developed the conditional tokens framework, which powers decentralized prediction markets like the Omen platform. Conditional tokens are a new event-based digital asset class. Through enabling conditional logic (“if this, then that”) for digital assets, the conditional tokens framework can mint digital assets with value contingent on arbitrarily complex logic. The conditional tokens framework enables deeper combinatorial prediction markets, making information discovery for correlated events easy to access. 
What is Gnosis Protocol?
Gnosis Protocol is a fully permissionless DEX that maximizes liquidity with ring trades, order settlements that share liquidity across all orders rather than a single token pair. In 2021, Gnosis will release Gnosis Protocol v2, which will expand on and improve v1 with features including gasless UX, access to on-chain liquidity, and front-running prevention through uniform clearing prices in each batch auction.
What is the Gnosis Safe Multisig?
Gnosis Safe Multisig is the most trusted platform to manage digital assets on Ethereum. Users can fully customize how they or their team manage crypto assets, with the option to require a predefined number of signatures to confirm transactions. Users can now also put their funds to work in DeFi protocols directly from the platform using Safe Apps. Use your digital assets to invest, earn, borrow, invoice, do payroll, and more.. Gnosis Safe currently holds more than 2% of the total ETH supply and over $12B in total value
What can you do with Gnosis Token? / Who governs Gnosis?
GnosisDAO is the prediction market-driven collective. Testing the limits of governance by prediction markets, known as futarchy, GnosisDAO will use Gnosis products to transparently guide decisions on development, support, and governance of its token ecosystem. Each product has complementary tokenomics designed to bring value to the Gnosis utility token: GNO. After initialization, GnosisDAO is to have effective control over 150K ETH and 8 Million GNO tokens. Anyone can participate today by joining the Gnosis Forum. 
How to obtain Gnosis Token (GNO)?
GNO tokens are available for purchase on some decentralized and centralized exchanges.

112,holotoken,"Holochain enables a distributed web with user autonomy built directly into its architecture and protocols. Data is about remembering our lived and shared experiences. Distributing the storage and processing of that data can change how we coordinate and interact. With digital integration under user control, Holochain liberates our online lives from corporate control over our choices and information.
Holochain is an energy efficient post-blockchain ledger system and decentralized application platform that uses peer-to-peer networking for processing agent centric agreement and consensus systems between users.
Holochain enables any device to have its own chain based ledger system. By using a holographic model for data storage and transfer developers can now create decentralized applications that can scale in multiple dimensions across a network ensuring they are truly distributed. This enables every device on a network to function independently, and only requires the synchronization of data when necessary, or agreed upon by users. This means every user is in control of their own data, and never has to risk their data being sold or exposed to 3rd parties like what just happened with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.
Holochain provides a framework for developers to build decentralized applications and aims to change the paradigm of data-centric blockchains to an agent-centric system. In Holochain’s fledgling system, no true global consensus is maintained. Instead, each agent in the public blockchain maintains a private fork, essentially, that is managed and stored in a limited way on the public blockchain with a distributed hash table. This means there are no scalability limits and dapps hosted on Holochain can do much more with less of nearly everything than traditional blockchains.
This system however has some inherent weaknesses. Because the entire blockchain must be verified by each member of the network, scalability problems quickly develop. The larger the amount of data being handled, the more restrictive the limit of transactions per second that can occur on the blockchain at any one time.Holochain itself is open source and written in Go. Go was selected for its ease of use and similarity to C. Dapps written specifically for Holochain can be developed with JavaScript or Lisp, with support for front-end systems using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
The developers added that Holochain is relatively flexible when it comes to handling new languages, so there is potential for growth on that front. Holochain bills itself as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional blockchains. Because there is no need for each individual agent to store and validate the global blockchain, Holochain only consumes a fraction of the bandwidth of traditional chains. Holochain also does not have a mining component, so there’s no electricity or processing power spent on proof-of-work calculations.
Arthur Brock and Eric Harris-Braun are the co-founders of Holochain and creators of Holochain. They have been designing alternatives currencies since the 80’s and have been working on Holu since before the Bitcoin whitepaper was written. To protect the incentives of users, founders and developers, Holochain is owned by a non-profit foundation. he company’s advisory team also includes Ryan Bubinski, the co-founder of CodeAcademy. In June, Holochain announced a new strategic partnership with Promether, an Adaptive Symbiotic Platform (ASP) that implements all the networking, security and anonymization code applications need to protect their data."

115,ravencoin,"Ravencoin is a blockchain specifically dedicated to the creation and peer-to-peer transfer of assets. Just as Monero is solely focused on privacy, Ravencoin specializes in asset transfer – nothing more, nothing less. Although you can exchange assets over other blockchains, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, that’s not their intended purpose. And the lack of specialization leads to problems that are specific to transferring assets. Ravencoin enables you to create and trade any real-world (e.g., gold bars, land deeds) or digital (e.g., gaming items, software licenses) assets on a network with only that in mind.
Ravencoin doesn’t have an established team. It’s an open-source project led by the core developers: RavoncoinDev, Tron, and Chatturga (discord usernames). Bruce Fenton, Board Member of The Bitcoin Foundation, advises the team. The core developers launched Ravencoin on January 3rd, 2018 and Fenton kicked off the launch with a Tweet announcing the start of mining. The project gained some notoriety when Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne announced that his company had made a multi-million dollar investment into the team. Since then, the team has been building out the core functionality of asset support and rewards capabilities.
The release of the Ravencoin mainnet and increase in activity on the platform should help the price. Any news of notable companies or financial institutions utilizing the platform should also have a positive effect. Ravencoin offers just one thing: tokenized asset transfer. And that singular focus isn’t a bad thing. When projects attempt to solve a bunch of problems at once, they often create a bunch of half-baked solutions. Ravencoin is avoiding that. As a young project with seemingly endless competition, it’s difficult to predict how successful Ravencoin will be. An active community and backing from one of the most respected names in online retail are positive indicators, though. There’s a clear trend toward the tokenization of all types of assets. However, we have yet to see whether or not Ravencoin will be leading that change."

Qtum uses proof-of-stake consensus, meaning node operators are rewarded for validating transactions. It is a DGP governed blockchain where community participants can vote to change certain network parameters. Qtum is built on a bitcoin core fork, but the foundation has created its own hybrid blockchain with the help of several key tools. The coin uses bitcoin’s chain because of its simple and stable nature, allowing the foundation to build upon it more easily.
As the QTUM project is a hybrid of Bitcoin and Ethereum, its team comprises of members from both Bitcoin and Ethereum community. They also have team members who formerly worked with Tencent, Alibaba, Nasdaq etc. Apart from that, they are backed by some notable VCs and prominent people from the Blockchain community such as Patrick Dai (Project Co-Founder), Neil Mahi (Chief Blockchain Architect/Co-Founder) and Jordan Earls (Lead Developer/Co-Founder).
Qtum provides a Turing-complete blockchain stack and is able to execute smart contracts and decentralised applications like the Ethereum blockchain.
Qtum builds on Bitcoin's UTXO transaction model and uses the Proof-of-Stake algorithm. It is backed by some highly prominent members of the blockchain community such as Anthony Di Iorio, Xu Star, Bo Shen, David Lee, Jehan Chu and Roger Ver.
Qtum sold over 10 million dollars’ worth of its tokens after only 90 minutes, eventually raising a total value of $15.7 million before stopping the campaign early after only 5 days. They raised a total amount of 11,156.766 bitcoins (BTC) and 77,081.031 ether (ETH) in exchange for the 51 million Qtum tokens being distributed to the public. In Qtum’s whitepaper, 51% of the coins were distributed to the public via the crowdfunding campaign. Of the remaining 49%, 29% of the coins would be allocated as community incentives, and the remaining 20% would be distributed to the early backers and development team. "
118,compound-governance-token,"COMP is the governance token for Compound Protocol and it was distributed since June 2020. It is an ERC-20 token issued on Ethereum. 

COMP tokens are mainly used for protocol governance. COMP holders can suggest, debate, and implement changes to Compound - without relying on, or requiring, the Compound team whatsoever. COMP also allows its owner to delegate voting rights to an address of their choice.
What is the Compound Protocol?
Compound is a decentralized blockchain protocol that allows users to lend or borrow selected cryptocurrencies. It establishes money markets by pooling assets together and algorithmically setting interest rates based on supply and demand of assets.
To supply or lend crypto assets on Compound, users will have to deposit their crypto assets into the Compound protocol and it will be aggregated into a liquidity pool. Once users have made the deposit, they will receive cTokens in return. Users will start accruing interest by holding the cTokens. 
Once assets are supplied to Compound, users are allowed to use the assets as collateral. Based on the collateral factor of the assets deposited, users can start borrowing from Compound. Because Compound uses an overcollateralization model, you can never borrow more than what is collateralized. 
 
Who founded Compound?

Compound was founded by long time business partners, Robert Leshner and Geoffrey Hayes in 2017. Compound officially launched on the Ethereum mainnet in 2018 and their headquarters is in San Francisco. 
   Robert Leshner, CEO           Geoffrey Hayes, CTO
How is Compound different from traditional finance?
Compound behaves similarly to a bank but it is more easily accessible. To use Compound, users are not required to provide personal and private information. Anyone with an internet connection could sign up for Compound and start interacting with the protocol. All they need is some crypto assets stored on a crypto wallet like Metamask.
In addition, the return rates for Compound are more attractive compared to traditional banks. For example, if you store money in a savings account, it will only generate a measly 0.05% APY. On the other hand, Compound would offer up to 4% APY depending on the assets supplied. 
Do note that the higher interest rate offered is due to the additional risks incurred by using the Compound smart contract.
Who are competitors of Compound Protocol?
Any services that facilitate lending of money is a competitor of Compound. In centralized finance, there are banks, money markets, and crypto lending services such as Nexo, Crypto.com, Celsius Network, Binance, and more. In DeFi, there are other competing services such as Aave.
How did Compound contribute to the yield farming / liquidity mining craze?
Yield farming is a process that allows users to earn a return on their crypto assets by providing it to Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols such as Compound. Liquidity mining is an additional incentive structure given through the reward of governance tokens to incentivize users to provide more liquidity to DeFi protocols. 
The release of COMP tokens in June 2020 jump started the yield farming and liquidity mining movement during the summer of 2020. COMP tokens were given to users who lent and borrowed assets on the Compound platform. This incentive made Compound extremely popular and significantly increased the assets lent and borrowed on Compound. 
How to farm for COMP?

If you supply or borrow assets on Compound, you will be rewarded with an allocation of COMP, of which 2,880 COMP are distributed daily. COMP tokens are distributed among the various money markets based on the dollar value of assets borrowed. Currently DAI has the highest demand, receiving about 60% of the daily COMP distribution. The allocation is then split equally between suppliers and borrowers.
Which assets are supported on Compound?
As of December 2020, there are 9 tokens available on Compound. The supported assets are DAI, ETH, USDC, ZRX, USDT, WBTC, BAT, UNI, COMP. 
How does Compound Governance work?
A user must have 100,000 COMP tokens on hand or delegated from other users to table a proposal. Once submitted, there is a 3-day voting period wherein a minimum of 400,000 votes must be cast. If a majority of the votes support the proposal, the new change will be implemented after a 2-day waiting period. 
These proposals may include adding support for a new asset, changing an asset’s collateral factor, changing a market’s interest rate model, or changing any other protocol parameter or variable. These proposals will be in the form of executable codes, not suggestions for the team to implement.

What is NXM?
NXM is the governance token for the Nexus Mutual protocol. It is used to buy cover, vote on governance decisions, and participate in Risk and Claims Assessments. It is also used to encourage capital provision and represents ownership to the mutual’s capital. As the mutual’s capital pool increases, the value of NXM will increase as well. 
The token’s price is determined using a bonding curve which is affected by both the amount of capital the mutual has and the amount of capital it needs to meet all claims with a certain probability. 
The NXM token is not traded on any exchange and is only used as an internal token for Nexus Mutual. To obtain the NXM token, one must register as a member of Nexus Mutual and go through the platform’s KYC and AML processes. 
A one-time membership fee of 0.002 ETH will also be charged. Once approved though, members can then obtain coverage and enjoy all the benefits that the NXM token provides. 
There is a ""wrapped"" version of the NXM token called Wrapped NXM (wNXM) that is freely transferable and can be bought on the open market through cryptocurrency exchanges. However, to make use of the wNXM token, it first needs to be unwrapped into NXM by a registered member of Nexus Mutual. After it is unwrapped, wNXM becomes NXM and can be used as usual on the platform.
What is Nexus Mutual?
Nexus Mutual is a decentralized insurance protocol built on Ethereum that currently offers cover for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, currently covering all the main defi protocols. Nexus Mutual offers coverage against smart contract failures, which protects against potential bugs in smart contract code. 
The coverage intends to provide protection against financial losses that may be incurred due to hacks or exploits in the smart contract code. Note that smart contract cover only protects against “unintended uses” of smart contracts, so security events such as the loss of private keys or centralized exchange hacks are not covered. In December 2020, it released custody cover covering centralised custodians and lenders such as Celsius, Blockfi, and Nexo. 
How to check the financial health status of the Nexus Mutual protocol?
Relevant on-chain financial metrics can be found on https://nexustracker.io/. 
How is the insurance coverage priced?
The price of cover is based on several criterias such as:

 
 Cover Amount
 
 
 Cover Period
 
 
 Amount of NXM tokens staked against the smart contract
 

Cover Amount
Cover Period
Amount of NXM tokens staked against the smart contract
How is risk assessment done on Nexus Mutual?
NXM holders can stake on various smart contract protocols to receive 50% of the premium sold. The programme allows up to 10x leverage, meaning with 100 NXM, the total amount of staking can go up to 1,000 NXM. 
For example, if a staker has 100 NXM and stakes 100 NXM each on 10 protocols, he will receive 50% of the premium received from the 10 protocols. However, the staker risks losing the whole 100 NXM even if only one of the 10 protocols has a valid claim. 
A project can incentivize staking by participating in a shield mining programme, by rewarding the project’s native token on top of NXM staking rewards in order to drive down the premium price. Premium price for a particular protocol will go down as more NXM tokens are staked against it. 
How to purchase cover?

 
 Users must first submit an application to become a member of Nexus Mutual.
 
 
 Specify which smart contract address users want cover for.
 
 
 Specify the Cover Amount, currency (ETH or DAI), and Cover Period.
 
 
 Generate a quote and process the transaction using an Ethereum wallet such as Metamask.
 
 
 You are now covered!

How to make a claim?
Members must stake a deposit in the form of NXM tokens which comes from the 10% of NXM tokens that were locked when purchasing cover. The required deposit is 5% of NXM tokens, which means a member can submit a claim for assessment twice. If the claim is accepted the deposit is returned, otherwise it is burned.
Has Nexus Mutual ever paid out claims before?
Yes! In the case of the bZx flash loan event in February 2020, there were 6 members who had cover on the smart contract for a total cover of roughly $87,000. Three claims submitted by these members were accepted for an overall payout of $34,996, disbursed immediately after Risk Assessors voted to accept their claims.
Can I buy the cover without KYC?
Nexus Mutual’s partnership with Yearn Finance has provided a path for non-mutual members to buy cover without KYC. The project is spinned off into Armor.

Serum is a decentralized exchange (DEX) providing high speed and low transaction costs for decentralized finance (DeFi).
Serum is the only high-performant DEX designed around a fully on-chain central limit order book and matching engine. Ecosystem partners can compose with Serum’s on-chain orderbook to share liquidity and power their trading features for institutional and retail users.
In light of the popularity of DeFi and the growth of DEXes on Ethereum, users and developers are limited by high gas costs and slow transactions. Serum aims to resolve these traditional problems of DeFi, as well as issues of centralization, low capital efficiency, and liquidity segmentation.
The Serum token (SRM) grants its holders governance rights to the protocol, staking rewards, discounts on trading fees, and earnings from fees.
Who are the people behind Serum?
Serum is an open source project created by a consortium of partners including FTX, Alameda Research, and the Solana Foundation.
What makes Serum unique?
Unlike most decentralized exchanges which are based on the automated market making model (AMM) such as Uniswap and Curve, Serum provides a limit order book and matching engine to traders. Traders are not just limited to making a market order, but are able to also place order at different prices, giving them a similar experience to using a centralized exchange. Any crypto projects with a token can leverage on Serum to bootstrap liquidity and have a matching service for trading.
Instead of building on Ethereum, Serum chosed Solana as the platform to be developed on. Solana is a high speed blockchain that can scale up to over 50,000 transactions per second at 400ms block time providing the speed and finality that an orderbook matching engine like Serum is looking for.
The ultimate goal for Serum is to re-create competing experience of a centralized exchange, completely on the blockchain.

What is Yearn Finance?
Yearn Finance is a suite of products in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) that provides lending aggregation, yield generation, and insurance on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol is maintained by various independent developers and is governed by YFI holders.
It started out as a passion project by Andre Cronje to automate the process of switching capital between lending platforms in search of the best yield offered, as the lending yield is a floating rate rather than fixed rate. Funds are shifted between dYdX, AAVE, and Compound automatically as interest rates change between these protocols. 
The service offered includes major USD tokens such as DAI, USDT, USDC, and TUSD. For example, if a user deposits DAI into yearn.finance, the user will receive yDAI token in return, which is a yield-bearing DAI token. 
Later on, it collaborated with Curve Finance to release a yield-bearing USD tokens pool that includes four y-tokens: yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDC and yTUSD, it is named as yUSD. 
Yearn Finance debuted the vault feature after its token launch, igniting a frenzy on automated yield farming and is considered the initiator of the category of yield farming aggregator. Basically, the vault will help users to claim yield farming rewards and sell it for the underlying assets. 
Vaults benefit users by socializing gas costs, automating the yield generation and rebalancing process, and automatically shifting capital as opportunities arise. End users also do not need to have proficient knowledge of the underlying protocols involved or DeFi, thus the Vaults represent a passive-investing strategy. It is akin to a crypto hedge fund where the aim is to increase the amount of assets that users deposited.
Yearn Finance in 2021
Yearn Finance was launched in July 2020 and its governance token, YFI was released to the community through a fair launch. At its initial release, because there were no fundraising nor valuation placed on Yearn Finance, the market did not fully comprehend the value capture and not able to figure out the market value for it.
As Yearn Finance continued to attract liquidity by allowing people to easily earn and participate in DeFi, YFI token went from $30 to $43,000 within 2 months from its launch.
In 2021, Yearn Finance continues to solidify its position as the gold standard for yield aggregator in which it managed to hit an all-time high of $91,000 on May 12th, 2021 alongside with the peak of the cryptocurrency markets.
What is Yield Farming and Delegated Vaults?
Yield Farming refers to the activity of depositing and locking capital in a DeFi Protocol for the reward of the protocol’s native tokens. DeFi protocols need to bootstrap capital to provide liquidity for exchanges, lend to borrowers, underwrite insurance risk, etc. It acts as an incentive to attract users to use the protocol while generating hype, giving out part of its native tokens. 
Other than simple yield farming, Yearn Finance also released a product named delegated vault. Delegated vaults basically use any assets as collateral to borrow stablecoins and recycle the stablecoins into a stablecoin vault. Any subsequent earnings are then used to buy back the asset. 
For example, one of the delegated vaults is yETH, where users can deposit ETH and expect to have more ETH when they withdraw. The ETH is sent to Maker DAO as collateral in order to draw DAI where the DAI will be invested into the DAI vault, with subsequent earnings used to buy back ETH. 
Why is the founder, Andre Cronje controversial or famous? 
Andre became one of the most famous DeFi thought leaders as he launched Yearn Finance single-handedly, witnessing YFI price went up by roughly 55x in less than 3 months, valuing Yearn Finance by more than $1 billion. He is vocal on Twitter with his ethos of fair token launch and having a bias on launching experimental projects before audits, which gave birth to one of the DeFi main activities “Aping”. 
Aping basically means buying the tokens the moment it launches in Ethereum mainnet before fully knowing the function of the tokens. It normally involves directly interacting with the Ethereum contract before a website UI is out or buying it straight from DEX such as Uniswap. It is a high risk activity, causing many investors to lose their fund to scams. But the lure of getting early access to tokens that might go up rapidly in price is attracting tons of speculators. 
One of the examples is when Andre launched EMN, a game economy engine called “Eminence” that was subsequently hacked for $15 million. Subsequent launch of the KP3R token, a network that facilitates keepers to perform automated tasks on behalf of requestors, saw the price go up by 22x in less than 3 months, valuing KP3R at more than $100 million. The activity of aping will not die down anytime soon with numerous projects achieving high valuation within a short span of time.

RSR is the governance token for the Reserve Project. 
 
How to obtain RSR?
RSR can be purchased from exchanges such as Uniswap or Binance. You can find RSR trading on various centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges. 
What is the Reserve Project?
Reserve project aims to create a censorship resistant USD stablecoin, RSV and decentralized fiat on/off ramps. Ultimately, Reserve’s goal is to create a universal store of value, particularly in regions with unreliable banking infrastructure and regions where hyperinflation is an issue.
Reserve Project believes that the most responsible path to launch a decentralized digital currency is to start with a centralized fiat stablecoin, gather the necessary usage data, and use that data to evolve to a fully decentralized model. Below are the three phases in their roadmap: 

 
 The centralized phase - Reserve is backed by a small number of collateral tokens, each of which is a tokenized US dollar.
 
 
 The decentralized phase - Reserve is backed by a changing basket of assets in a decentralized way, but still stabilized in price with respect to the US dollar.
 
 
 The independent phase - Reserve is no longer pegged to the US dollar. It intends to stabilize its real purchasing power regardless of fluctuations in the value of the US dollar.

The independent phase - Reserve is no longer pegged to the US dollar. It intends to stabilize its real purchasing power regardless of fluctuations in the value of the US dollar.
Reserve Project is still in phase 1 where the USD stablecoin that was released, RSV is pegged by equal portions of USDC, TUSD, and PAX. 
Currently, users are mainly from Venezuela and Argentina, two countries that have experienced hyperinflation on their respective national currencies. Reserve Project provides US dollars access to the citizens of Venezuela and Argentina, helping them to save with US dollars and transact with low friction. 
RSR token is still currently exploring for a suitable revenue model. Ideas include the following:

 
 Obtain fees from issuers of USDC, TUSD and PAX for having a larger slice of RSV collateral portfolio.
 
 
 Enact a transaction fees for using RSV
 
 
 Enable collateralised lending for the underlying USDC, TUSD, and PAX.

Enable collateralised lending for the underlying USDC, TUSD, and PAX.
How does RSV maintain its peg to $1?
If the price of Reserve on the open market is lower than $1, arbitrageurs will be incentivized to buy it up and redeem it with the Reserve smart contract for $1.00 worth of collateral tokens. Arbitrageurs will continue buying on the open markets until the market price matches the redemption price of $1.00.
The same mechanism works in reverse when demand goes up. If the price of Reserve on the open market is higher than $1, arbitrageurs will be incentivized to mint new Reserve tokens for $1.00 worth of collateral and immediately sell them on the open market. They will continue selling on the open markets until the market price matches the purchase price of $1.00.

Also, it behaves as the building block for developers that are looking for exchange functionality. 0x allows easy integration for developers through its relayers which adds exchange functionality on top of an existing product. 0x’s vision is to enable a direct, non-custodial wallet-to-wallet trading of any ERC-20 tokens on any Ethereum based platforms. 
0x currently has three main products:

 
 0x API - Gain access to decentralized exchanges (DEX) liquidity through an API and swap token for the best price
 
 
 Matcha - An aggregator of decentralized exchanges allowing users to find the best prices for token swaps
 
 
 0x Mesh - Gain access to a global peer-to-peer orderbook for token trades

Matcha - An aggregator of decentralized exchanges allowing users to find the best prices for token swaps
0x Mesh - Gain access to a global peer-to-peer orderbook for token trades
How does 0x work?
The 0x network revolves around the maker and taker. Maker is the party that creates a buy or sell order while taker is the party that fills the order. Currently 0x supports trading for ERC-20 fungible tokens.  
0x allows order makers to securely initiate a transaction with digital signatures and an 0x order is only considered valid after it has met all of the steps shown in the image below.

In order for a trade to occur, there needs to be someone on the other side of the trade. If the maker already has a desired counter-party, they could directly send the 0x order to them. Otherwise, the order will be sent to a relayer in hopes of finding a counter-party.  
A relayer is an entity that helps to create, find, and fill 0x orders. Anyone can build a 0x relayer and begin earning fees for every trade it facilitates
Once someone finds and fills the 0x order, the 0x protocol’s settlement logic will verify the maker’s digital signature and make sure the conditions of the trade are completely met. If everything is in order, tokens will be automatically swapped between maker and taker. Otherwise, the request will be rejected. 
Because 0x supports ERC-721 non-fungible tokens (NFT) as well, there could be a viable use case for gaming or digital artwork scenarios. Gamers can tokenize their in-game assets and trade among themselves. Artists can also digitize their artwork into a NFT and turn it into a trading product. 
Does 0x store orders on-chain?

Unlike other decentralized exchanges, 0x does not store its orders on the blockchain. Instead orders are stored off-chain and trade settlements are only taken place on-chain. By taking transactions off-chain, there will be less congestion within the network and it would demand lower gas cost to operate within the 0x ecosystem.
The only part where the transaction occurs on-chain is the actual value transfer.

141,livepeer,"The Livepeer project aims to deliver a live video streaming network protocol that is fully decentralized, highly scalable, crypto token incentivized, and results in a solution which can serve as the live media layer in the decentralized development (web3) stack. In addition, Livepeer is meant to provide an economically efficient alternative to centralized broadcasting solutions for any existing broadcaster. In this document we describe the Livepeer Protocol - a delegated stake based protocol for incentivizing participants in a live video broadcast network in a game-theoretically secure way. We present solutions for the scalable verification of decentralized work, as well as the prevention of useless work in an attempt to game the token allocations in an inflationary system.
The Livepeer Token (LPT) is the protocol token of the Livepeer network. But it is not the medium of exchange token. Broadcasters use Ethereum's Ether (ETH) to broadcast video on the network. Nodes who contribute processing and bandwidth earn ETH in the form of fees from broadcasters. LPT is a staking token that participants who want to perform work on the network stake in order to coordinate how work gets distributed on the network, and to provide security that the work will get done honestly and correctly. LPT has the following purposes:
It serves as a bonding mechanism in a delegated proof of stake system, in which stake is delegated towards transcoders (or validators) who participate in the protocol to transcode video and validate work. The token, and potential slashing that occurs due to protocol violation, is necessary in order to secure the network against a number of attacks. More below.
It routes work through the network in proportion to the amount of staked and delegated token, essentially serving as a coordination mechanism.
It is a unit of account that is specific to the Livepeer ecosystem, which forms the basis of a SectorCoin concept, applicable to additional functionality to be introduced in the future. Services such as DVR, closed captioning, ad insertion/monetization, and analytics can all plug into the Livepeer ecosystem and potentially make use of the security provided by staking LPT.
An initial allocation of Livepeer Token will be distributed so that stakeholders can fulfill various roles in, and use the network, and then additional token will be issued according to algorithmically programmed issuance over time.
Following the conventions of Ethereum and many popular ERC20 tokens, LPT will be divisible by 10 ^ 18, with larger denominations such as the LPT itself intended to be used for user level transactions such as staking, and smaller denominations intended to be used for protocol accounting."

146,golem,"Golem is a decentralized supercomputer that is accessible by anyone. The system is made up of the combined power of user’s machines from personal PCs to entire datacenters. Golem is able to compute almost any tasks from CGI rendering through machine learning to scientific learning. It utilizes an ethereum-based transaction system to clear payments between providers, requestors and software developers however it is safe because all computations take place in sandbox environments and are fully isolated from the hosts’ systems. 
The company released Brass in 2016 which includes Blender and LuxRender which are the two tools for CGI rendering. There are three releases that follows which are Clay, Stone and Iron. Golem has recently updated their Brass Beta and the highlight of this upgrade are the streamlined task creation GUI, the support for partial task restart in case of subtask timeouts and the fix that should alleviate the issues with the Docker service on Windows. Other than that, improvements have been made on the Blender verification and transaction tracking subsystems and fixed some minor pain-points in the UX. Transaction history will become more user-friendly with separate tabs for payments and incomes. Apart from that, improvements are made for requestors as well, requestors is now able to add resource file without having to repeat the task creation procedure if they have forgotten to add them beforehand. 
Grand vision and core features

 Golem is the first truly decentralized supercomputer, creating a global market for computing power. Combined with flexible tools to aid developers in securely distributing and monetizing their software, Golem altogether changes the way compute tasks are organized and executed. By powering decentralized microservices and asynchronous task execution, Golem is set to become a key building block for future Internet service providers and software development. And, by substantially lowering the price of computations, complex applications such as CGI rendering, scientific calculation, and machine learning become more accessible to everyone.
  
 Golem connects computers in a peer-to-peer network, enabling both application owners and individual users (""requestors"") to rent resources of other users’ (""providers"") machines. These resources can be used to complete tasks requiring any amount of computation time and capacity. Today, such resources are supplied by centralized cloud providers which, are constrained by closed networks, proprietary payment systems, and hard-coded provisioning operations. Also core to Golem’s built-in feature set is a dedicated Ethereum-based transaction system, which enables direct payments between requestors, providers, and software developers.
  
 The function of Golem as the backbone of a decentralized market for computing power can be considered both Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), as well as Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). However, Golem reveals its true potential by adding dedicated software integrations to the equation. Any interested party is free to create and deploy software to the Golem network by publishing it to the Application Registry. Together with the Transaction Framework, developers can also extend and customize the payment mechanism resulting in unique mechanisms for monetizing software.

147,sushi,"What is Sushi?
Sushi is a DeFi protocol that is completely community-driven, serving up delicious interest for your held crypto assets.
On Sushi, you can take advantage of passive-income providing DeFi tools such as liquidity providing, yield farming and staking. Furthermore, due to the decentralized nature of being an AMM (Automated Market Maker), Sushi has fewer hurdles to execute your cryptocurrency trades and all fees are paid to the users who provided liquidity, just as it should be!
Sushi is host to many hidden gems that are unavailable on other, similar exchanges, so it is a great way to discover new, exclusive opportunities. Sushi, serving DeFi’s best!
What is the SUSHI token?
SUSHI is a governance token that enables community governance over the Sushi ecosystem. This means that SUSHI holders can use their tokens to vote for platform proposals to further ecosystem initiatives.
The SUSHI token can be farmed by participating in the yield farming program.
The SUSHI token may also be staked across various platforms such as Sushi's very own, SushiBar, or can be used as collateral on platforms such as Sushi's Yearn ecosystem partner, Aave.
Where to buy SUSHI?
SUSHI is now considered as one of the top tier DeFi token in the industry. If you are looking to buy or sell SUSHI tokens, you will find it in most exchanges in the market. If you have an account on a centralized exchange, you can buy SUSHI from Coinbase, Binance, Bitfinex, FTX, Gemini, Kraken, and more. For decentralized exchange option, you can trade SUSHI on Sushiswap, Uniswap, and 1inch.
Is SUSHI a good investment?
When Sushiswap was launched, the SUSHI token was traded as low as $0.50 each due to the incident of Chef Nomi, its creator leaving the project with the development fund. After that the project leadership shifted to 0xmaki and the community in which we saw the token trading at almost $23 at an all-time-high, which is a staggering 4600% ROI increase since the lows. While the token price is volatile as we see correctional waves due to speculation, the SUSHI token also extracts value from trading fees. That is, SUSHI holders can stake to redeem xSUSHI which entitles them to earn 0.05% for all trades on Sushiswap.
The History of Sushi
Sushi was announced in September of 2020 by an anonymous developer going by the name of, Chef Nomi. Upon its release, Sushi, also known as SushiSwap, attracted a lot of industry attention for labelling itself a community-driven AMM (Automated Market Maker). It was an exciting platform idea that spoke to the ethos of true decentralization.
Upon gaining quite a lot of traction in the DeFi community, Chef Nomi felt his work was done and made his exit by removing $14 million in SUSHI tokens from the Sushi development fund, which is the amount he personally felt he deserved for developing the platform. Many people felt this was in direct contrast to his community-driven platform vision, so he gave the funds back and asked the community to decide the amount he deserved.
When this event took place, many industry members believed that it had damaged Sushi’s reputation too much for the platform to continue. However, an early Sushi believer, 0xMaki, stepped up to fill the empty role of Sushi lead and built the platform to incredible heights, even overtaking Uniswap in total platform liquidity on more than one occasion. Due to this unbelievable comeback, many people admire the Sushi community and team for growing the platform back and beyond the platform it was in its early days.
Sushi, still led by 0xMaki, now has a bigger team than ever, of talented individuals, creating innovative products such as BentoBox, Kashi, MISO, Mirin and Shoyu. Sushi's history has only just begun.

148,icon,"ICON is a blockchain technology and network framework designed to allow independent blockchains to interact with each other. ICON is supported through a cryptocurrency token, called ICX. ICON is a South Korean-based company that developed a blockchain technology and accompanying cryptocurrency token called ICX. The company bills itself as an interconnected blockchain network, allowing participants in a decentralized system to “converge” at a central point.
This is done by connecting a community to other communities through ICON Republic and Citizen Nodes. While blockchains are most commonly associated with cryptocurrencies, enthusiasts point out other areas where the technology can be applied. Any exchange of information can technically be added to a blockchain, though adding some types may not be cost-effective. Transactions involving securities, currencies, business contracts, deeds and loans, intellectual property, and personal identification could be “tokenized.
ICON’s blockchain is more like the Plasma or Ontology blockchain in that its purpose is to act as an intermediary between other blockchains and networks. This interconnectability makes the ICON project worth keeping an eye on over the next decade.
ICON sports its very own decentralized exchange. This DEX sets currency reserves for each blockchain community so that ICON communities can exchange value in real time through the ICON Republic. In this way, DEX complements C-Rep portals by establishing another gateway for ICON Communities to connect to the ICON Republic."

In more traditional blockchains, the host provides the food/drinks (i.e resources) for this party. And when the guests arrive, the amount of resources can only accommodate so many people, the portions are small and then everything eventually runs out and the party ends. Think Constellation DAG like a potluck (a party where everyone brings food/drinks). With every added guest (node to the network), the more resources the party has to keep going. This is the nature of Constellation, a distributed system that scales horizontally.
Is Constellation a Blockchain?
Not exactly. Although inspired by the principles of decentralization, many standard blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum face scalability issues. This is why the next, generation of decentralized networks such as Hashgraph, IOTA, and Constellation have turned to DAG.

The only difference is Sia uses blockchain to facilitate transactions Nodes provide storage to clients using the Sia blockchain as contracts. Before storing the data, the data is encrypted into many pieces and uploaded to different hosts. 
Siacoin is created by David Vorick and Luke Champine of Nebulous Inc. As the traditional storage platforms are higher in cost, more expensive and data is not well protected. Siacoin promises to offer secured storage transactions with smart contracts which is more affordable and reliable. Moreover, it is completely open source which means many individuals have contributed to Siacoin’s software hence there will be an active community building innovative applications on top if the Sia API. 
In 2018, Siacoin aims to introduce file sharing and be the go-to cloud storage platform for companies. Their goal is divided into 3 time frames which are short-term, medium-term and long-term development. Short-term development focuses on file sharing between Sia users. This allows Sia users to share files in the platform without having to take it off the cloud while increasing network utilization. Medium-term development’s goal is to enhance partnerships. This means reaching out to large companies like Netflix and Dropbox to hopefully be able to be their storage and distribution framework.

161,balancer,"What is BAL?

BAL is the governance token for the Balancer Protocol. It can be used to vote on proposals and steer the direction of the protocol. 
The total supply of BAL is capped at 100 million tokens, 25 million of which is allocated to the founding members, core developers, advisers, and investors. The rest are being distributed to the community through liquidity mining.
What is Balancer?
Balancer is a multi-token automated market maker (AMM) that functions as a self-balancing weighted portfolio protocol. Balancer is built on the Ethereum network. It allows anyone to create or add liquidity to customizable pools and earn trading fees. Compared to a typical constant product AMM model, Balancer uses a generalization formula that could be adjusted to any number of tokens at any amount of weightage. 
It mimics the concept of an index fund where assets are regularly being reallocated based on the price and returns of the assets. Index fund is a common financial instrument that helps investors to achieve risk diversification by maintaining a controlled risk exposure to a portfolio. Rather than paying a portfolio manager to actively or programmatically manage users' funds, Balancer helps solve a similar problem with smart contracts.  
How is the Balancer Protocol useful?
There are two types of users that can benefit from using Balancer: liquidity providers and traders. Liquidity providers are the ones who own Balancer pools or participate in shared pools. Traders are the users that buy and sell ERC-20 tokens on the open market. 
Liquidity providers can have a controlled exposure to different crypto assets without costly and complicated rebalancing. At the same time, liquidity providers can earn passive income by utilizing the ERC-20 tokens that are sitting idle in their wallets. 
Traders can exchange tokens, have access to a diverse set of pools, and seek profit by arbitraging price differences on Balancer with other exchanges.
How does Balancer work?
The fundamental building block of the Balancer Protocol is the Balancer Pool. Balancer Pool can be viewed as an automated, market-making portfolio. Each token asset has an independent weight, and can be traded against other tokens in the pool. For example, you could have a pool with three tokens in the following proportions: 50% DAI, 25% SUSHI, and 25% WETH.
The concept of a Balancer pool is to keep the value function of the pool’s weights and balances to a constant. If the relative prices of the tokens change, the pool as a whole is continuously rebalanced to maintain each token's proportion of the total value. 
Each trade that occurs in a Balancer Pool generates a fee for the pool owner. The fee is a percentage of the trading volume and is adjustable by the pool owner when the pool is created.
Balancer has a few pools available:

 
 Private Pools - Private pools are completely controlled by the owner. Only the owner can contribute liquidity and has full permissions over the parameters of the pool.
 
 
 Shared Pools - Creators of shared pools only have one opportunity to permanently set the pool parameters including number of tokens, weightage, and trading fees. The creator doesn’t have any special privileges over the shared pool and anyone may contribute liquidity to the pool. The ownership of the pool’s liquidity is tracked by a specific token called the Balancer Pool Token (BPT).
 
 
 Smart Pools - Smart pools are a variation of private pools where the controller is a smart contract, enabling arbitrary logic to determine how parameters can be adjusted. Anyone may contribute liquidity to a smart pool and asset ownership is tracked by BPT. 
 

Private Pools - Private pools are completely controlled by the owner. Only the owner can contribute liquidity and has full permissions over the parameters of the pool.
Shared Pools - Creators of shared pools only have one opportunity to permanently set the pool parameters including number of tokens, weightage, and trading fees.

The ownership of the pool’s liquidity is tracked by a specific token called the Balancer Pool Token (BPT).
Smart Pools - Smart pools are a variation of private pools where the controller is a smart contract, enabling arbitrary logic to determine how parameters can be adjusted. Anyone may contribute liquidity to a smart pool and asset ownership is tracked by BPT. 
How are Balancer Pools continuously rebalanced?
Pools are efficiently rebalanced through a multi-dimensional invariant function used to continuously define swap prices between any two tokens in a pool. Essentially, it is an n-dimensional generalization of Uniswap's x * y = k formula.
Whenever market prices are different from those offered by a Balancer Pool, arbitrageurs will make the most profit by trading with that pool until its prices equal those on the external market. When this happens, it cancels out the arbitrage opportunity. These arbitrage opportunities guarantee that, in a rational market, prices offered by any Balancer Pool are identical to the rest of the market.
Instead of doing work and paying fees to rebalance users’ portfolios, Balancer Pool creators earn fees while traders do the rebalancing work for them. 
How to get BAL?
Users can provide liquidity to whitelisted Balancer pools and they will be entitled to receive BAL tokens proportional to how much liquidity that is contributed. 145,000 BAL will be distributed to liquidity providers every week. 
Another method to acquire BAL is to directly buy it from various exchanges such as SushiSwap or Coinbase.

175,polymath,"Polymath provides technology to create, issue, and manage security tokens on the blockchain. Over 200 security tokens have been deployed using their Ethereum-based solution and they are now in the midst of launching Polymesh, an institutional-grade blockchain built specifically for regulated assets. Polymath streamlines antiquated processes and opens the door to new financial instruments by solving the inherent challenges with public infrastructure around identity, compliance, confidentiality, and governance. 
Recognizing that the industry lacked security-specific standards, Polymath spearheaded the creation of a unified standard for security tokens on Ethereum, ERC 1400. ERC 1400 acts as an umbrella of standards and is designed to address some of the challenges in managing security tokens by enabling the ability to conserve UBO rights for custodied assets, and automate transfer control (including KYC verification) and corporate actions (including capital distribution or voting). 
Polymath has brought forward many advanced innovations that address regulatory and market needs head-on. They have built a series of tools on the chain that offer non-technical users an intuitive means to access the chain’s functionality, and are also in the midst of launching Polymesh, an institutional-grade blockchain built for security tokens and the first specialized chain of this nature. Security tokens have the ability to alter the financial landscape, unlocking trillions of dollars in asset value and investment, programmably automating operations, and driving new paths to liquidity - but there are significant barriers standing in the way of institutional adoption. The foundations of Polymesh are focused on the most crucial regulatory elements addressed by four key design principles meant to meet the demands of regulators and institutions. Those four principles are Identity, Compliance, Confidentiality, and Governance. When put together, these four pillars can also support complex operations, such as settlement. 
When it comes to creating and managing digital securities, Polymesh’s specificity gives it, and the applications built on it, a distinct advantage over those leveraging general-purpose blockchains. The purpose-built infrastructure addresses the gaps in standard blockchain architecture to align the functioning of the blockchain with the requirements of modern capital markets. By combining Polymesh’s deep functionality with user-friendly tools, Polymath stands to transform capital markets.
All transactions on the Polymath platform take place using the native POLY token. POLY is the utility token that fuels Polymath Token Studio on Ethereum and is used by issuers creating and managing security tokens on the platform. "

179,uma,"What is UMA?
UMA is an optimistic oracle (OO) that can record any knowable truth onto a blockchain. It tells smart contracts “things about the world” so contracts and markets asking for that data can be settled. The OO has been called “a human-powered truth machine” because it is flexible enough to handle ambiguity and expands the design space possible in web3. UMA’s OO secures a diverse ecosystem of web3 applications, including cross-chain bridges, insurance protocols, prediction markets, and customizable DAO tooling products. 
The Across bridge, Polymarket prediction markets, and Outcome.Finance DAO tools are some of the use cases for the OO.
Why are oracles important?
Oracles are a key part of blockchain infrastructure. They enable communication between the external world and on-chain environments in a trustless manner. Oracles are vital for many parts of the blockchain industry including decentralized finance (DeFi) and web3 applications.
UMA’s optimistic oracle
An optimistic oracle like UMA's uses a “true unless disputed” pattern. Anyone can propose an answer to a data request, and it is accepted as true if it is not disputed during a verification period. The “optimistic” design differs from a price-feed oracle, where prices are streamed on-chain and are instantly final.
This optimistic oracle design concept has been in development since 2014, when Vitalik first published on the matter. There have been several iterations over the years since then, including UMA’s. The optimistic design pattern introduces the opportunity for human intelligence to weigh in. This is important for web3 projects as they require arbitrary data that is not always possible to turn into code. 
Today, the OO provides flexible, unique dispute resolution involving any kind of question or data with human input, as compared to price feed oracles, which can only push regular price updates onto chains. The OO can be plugged into any type of DeFi protocol. 
A brief history of UMA
UMA was founded in 2018 by Allison Lu and Hart Lambur, two ex Goldman Sachs traders, with the goal of making global markets universally fair, accessible, secure and decentralized. The team drew inspiration from traditional finance derivatives to define an open-source protocol to allow anyone, anywhere, to design and build trustless financial contracts.
How does the UMA platform work?
There are three actors in UMA’s Optimistic Oracle system: the contract requesting the data, the participant offering the data, and a potential disputant, who can dispute data if they disagree.
If a dispute arises, UMA token holders resolve the dispute within 48 hours. If the disputer is right, they get a portion of the proposer's deposit as a reward; if the disputer is wrong, they lose their deposit as a penalty, a portion of which goes to the proposer. Voting in the oracle has three phases: open voting; voting confirmation/reveal; and rewards claim period. 
Rewards will compound as they are claimed. Claiming the rewards places the tokens in users’ wallets, making them active voting tokens that will increase the user’s voting power with each successful vote.
UMA’s smart contracts are designed primarily for developers building decentralized applications. However, all UMA token owners can participate in UMA’s optimistic oracle. UMA’s token is built on Ethereum that can be held in wallets like Metamask, Trezor, or Ledger, which must be connected to the UMA DApp to enable voting.
What can you do with a UMA token?
The UMA token has traded on top exchanges for years. The token provides economic guarantees to protocols using UMA’s OO. UMA’s community of token holders provide the human component, as voters, for the OO's final resolution on disputes or queries. Tokens are also used to vote on protocol upgrades and UMA DAO funds allocations. The strength of the token will track with the strength and adoption of the UMA ecosystem as a whole. Active and accurate voters earn a healthy yield for their participation.
How can I get involved?
The UMA community is on Discord. There, you can learn how to vote with your tokens and discuss with other community members how you should vote. You can also contribute as a developer or researcher.
Has UMA been audited?
Yes, all of UMA's oracle contracts have been audited by OpenZeppelin, in addition to the contracts for Across Protocol and Outcome's Optimistic Governor, Optimistic Distributor, and more. All of our audit reports can be found here.

181,smooth-love-potion,"What is Smooth Love Potion (SLP)?
Smooth Love Potion (SLP) tokens can be earned as rewards by Axie Infinity players through battle or adventure mode. SLP are tokens that can be used to breed new digital pets, known as Axies. It was formally known as Small Love Potion before the token upgrade to the Ronin blockchain.
The cost of breeding begins at 100 SLP but increases gradually — rising to 200 SLP for the second breed, 300 for the third, 500 for the fourth, 800 for the fifth, and 1,300 for the sixth. Axies can be bred a maximum of seven times, and the seventh breed costs 2,100 SLP. This limit exists in order to prevent hyperinflation in the marketplace.
SLP paves the way to the concept of Play-to-earn which popularizes the Axie Infinity games among players who are looking to earn some money or participate in DeFi. It is especially popular in countries like Philippines.
Besides SLP, Axie Infinity has a governance token called AXS which players can use to participate in determining the future direction of the game.
How can I earn SLP?
You can earn SLP by playing the Axie Infinity game through winning battles and fulfilling daily quests hence the ""play to earn"" term was coined. To start playing the game, you would need to obtain some Axies from the marketplace, which are creatures that can be used to battle other players in the game. Another way of obtaining Axies would be through some interest groups that offer Axies as a loan in the form of a scholarship. SLP earned from the game are splitted between the scholarship holders and the group lending out the Axies.
How much SLP can I earn per day?
SLP earnings can vary depending on the players' skill and their energy resources. With the latest update, players can only earn SLP by competing in arena mode by battling other players. P2E mode will no longer reward players with new supply of tokens.

184,digibyte,"What is DigiByte?
DigiByte is more than a faster digital currency. It is an innovative blockchain that can be used for digital assets, smart contracts, decentralized applications and secure authentication.
What makes DigiByte stronger than others?
DigiByte is a rapidly growing open-source blockchain created in late 2013 and released in early 2014. After 6 years of forward thinking development, DigiByte has become one of the safest, fastest, longest and most decentralized UTXO blockchain in existence.
Truly Decentralized.
DigiByte has never been funded through an ICO or significant amount of premined coins. There is no CEO or a company controlling the DigiByte blockchain. It is a volunteer based and global community driven project.
More secure.
DigiByte uses 5 cryptographic algorithms and real time difficulty adjustment to prevent malicious mining centralization and hash power fluctuation. One of which is Odocrypt that changes itself every 10 days for ASIC resistance.
Much faster.
DigiByte blocks occur every 15 seconds which is 40x faster than Bitcoin and 10x faster than Litecoin. Early SegWit implementation and blockchain rigidity enable up to 1066 on-chain transactions per second with negligible fees.
Forward thinking.
Over the past 6 years, DigiByte has repeatedly set itself apart with multiple blockchain firsts, such asDigiShield guard, MultiAlgo mining, SegWit implementation, Odocrypt algorithm, Dandelion++ privacy protocol, DigiAssets and Digi-ID.

 
This is how the DigiByte blockchain works.
The three layers are the most innovative parts of the DigiByte blockchain providing the network infrastructure, security and communications to function with cutting edge speed.
 
Applications / DigiAssets.
The top layer is like an app store with clear real-world uses. All types of digital assets can be created with the DigiAssets protocol on top of the DigiByte blockchain. Decentralized applications (dApps) can be built on top of the DigiByte blockchain. Also smart contracts that leverage the rigidity and security of the DigiByte blockchain can be encoded easily.
Digital asset / Public ledger.
The middle layer provides security and administration. A Digital Byte of data, a representation of larger data or a unit that holds value, and cannot be counterfeited, duplicated or hacked. An immutable public ledger where all transactions of DigiBytes are recorded. DigiByte uses five proof of work algorithms for security. New DigiBytes come from mining only.
Core protocol / Global network.
The bottom layer provides communication and operating procedures. A very low-level way nodes on the DigiByte global network communicate. Thousands of people are running DigiByte software all across the planet. Any server, computer, tablet or mobile phone connected to the DigiByte network becomes a node that helps relay transactions.

Open source / Permissionless.
Just like the DigiByte.io website, the DigiByte blockchain is completely open source and free to use released under the MIT license, which gives you the power to run and modify the software. Transparency allows for independent verification of binaries and their corresponding source code.
 
A digital currency you would absolutely love.
DigiByte (DGB) is a highly scalable peer-to-peer digital currency that enables industry-leading transaction speeds with negligible fees. DigiByte is the best way for payments.
Easy to use.
Getting started to use DigiByte is even easier than sending an SMS. You can send and receive DigiBytes using the devices you already know and love. All you need is installing a DigiByte supported wallet then click scan, scan the QR code and send DigiByte. As easy as 1..2..3.
Not an ICO.
DigiByte has never been funded through an ICO or significant amount of premined coins (0% remaining). There is no CEO or a company controlling the DigiByte blockchain. The founder, developers and the community are unpaid volunteers that eliminate the bankrupt risk.
Much faster.
DigiByte transactions are confirmed in approx. 15 seconds, which is 40 times faster than Bitcoin and 10 times faster than Litecoin. SegWit enables up to 1066 on-chain transactions per second and negligible fees make DigiByte the ideal currency for daily payments.

Always secure.
DigiByte has been built on the uncrackable technology of the Bitcoin blockchain and implemented various advanced enhancements over it such as DigiShield guard, MultiAlgo mining and the Odocrypt algorithm. Also Dandelion++ privacy protocol helps keep you safe by hiding your IP and physical location. Learn more.
Mineable.
DigiByte is a 100% Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain that can be mined with five algorithms called Sha256, Scrypt, Skein, Qubit and Odocrypt. MultiAlgo mining contributes to decentralization, security of the network and gives you the freedom to use different kind of hardware's such as an ASIC a FPGA or a GPU. Learn more.
Manageable units
Compared to 21 million Bitcoin, 21 billion DigiByte (1000:1 ratio to BTC) have been designed to be ready for mass adoption. DigiByte block rewards reduces by 1% every month instead of halving every 4 years. All 21 billion DigiByte will be mined by the year 2035. After 2035 the miners will then rely on transaction fees alone. Learn more.
A simplified way to create digital assets.
DigiAssets is a secure, scalable layer on top of the DigiByte blockchain that allows for the decentralized issuance of assets, tokens, smart contracts, digital identity and more.
Limitless possibilities.
DigiAssets can be used to securely represent anything we find in the physical world. From tangible assets such as real estate or cars, through to scarce digital pieces of art. Signed documents such as deeds and medical bills can be protected.
Growing confidently.
DigiAssets as an ecosystem and platform already has interested parties either planning on or currently building platforms in real estate, finance, remittance, identity, point of sale, racing, trade, healthcare, supply chain, government and more.
Solid technology.
DigiAssets leverages unique aspects of a truly decentralized blockchain only found within a permissionless blockchain like DigiByte. This allows DigiAssets to be more secure, scalable and decentralized than any other platform in the market.
Authentication at its best.
Digi-ID is a security protocol built on DigiByte blockchain technology that empowers users to effortlessly sign-in to websites, applications, and even into the internet of things.
 
Easy authentication.
Digi-ID eliminates the username, password and 2fa requirements for authentication. Because Digi-ID uses public / private key cryptography, there are no passwords or usernames at risk. This method not only protects the consumer, it also protects the services that the consumer uses.
 
Flawless security.
Digi-ID does not store any data about its users on the DigiByte blockchain. This further strengthens the security while also bolstering end-user’s confidence that their data is neither tracked nor at risk by others negligence. There is no external point of failure for an hacker to exploit your platform.
Simple and free.
Digi-ID is completely free! There are no fees, subscription services, or maintenance costs. But the cost is its second best feature. Its primary feature is that, in accordance with DigiBytes security prioritization, Digi-ID is a more secure, yet simple method available to log in to websites, apps and more.

The Lisk project is managed by the Lisk Foundation, a non-profit entity based in Zug, Switzerland. 
A local team of experts specialized in law and finance, as well as yearly audits, ensure the proper handling of funds and regulatory compliance under the supervision of the Swiss Federal Foundation Supervisory Authority (ESA, Eidgenössische Stiftungsaufsicht).
The Lisk products are developed by the Lightcurve GmbH, a Berlin based blockchain studio. 
With a team of over 40 blockchain experts, Lightcurve is researching, developing and promoting the Lisk SDK and the Lisk blockchain application platform.
What Makes Lisk Unique?
Accessibility
Accessibility is part of the Lisk vision. 
Lisk believes that not only technical people or the elite should have access to crypto and web3, but everyone in the world.
This vision flows through everything Lisk is doing and into their products.
Proven & established
Founded in 2016, Lisk is one of the oldest crypto projects in existence. 
The team has proven to diligently and consistently work on the project with one of the highest development activity in the industry and high funding to last for many years ahead.
Application-specific chains
Instead of relying on smart contracts, developers are implementing their blockchain applications natively on their own blockchain with the Lisk SDK. This prevents scalability issues and high fees, however maintains composability thanks to interoperability.
JavaScript
Instead of using archaic and niche or new and unproven programming languages, the Lisk SDK is fully written in JavaScript tapping into the biggest pool of developers globally.
How Is the Lisk Network Secured?
Lisk is secured through an environmentally friendly and highly efficient Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm and finality guaranteeing BFT protocol. 
Without the need for miners the electricity consumption of the entire network is kept to a minimum while ensuring high-throughput and security.
Industry-leading development standards and test coverage at Lisk ensures smooth operation since the launch of the network on May 24th, 2016. Regular third party security audits bring further trust and reputation.

How Many Lisk (LSK) Coins Are There in Circulation?
In 2016 at the time of the Lisk ICO the Lisk blockchain started with 100,000,000 LSK at a market value of $5,800,000. Approximately 6 years later, in February 2022, there are around 140,000,000 LSK available at a market value of $240,000,000. 
This represents an over 40x return, given the LSK token price now.
At launch, only 8% of the initial LSK token supply went to the Lisk co-founders, which is at the lower end of today’s standards.
Today, the annual inflation rate of the LSK token is only about 2% which is one of the industry’s lowest rates.

What is the Ren Protocol?
Ren Protocol is a permissionless and trustless protocol that allows users to transfer tokens across different blockchains. Ren’s core product, RenVM is focused on building an interoperability solution for Decentralized Finance (DeFi).

It was formerly known as Republic Protocol and originally wanted to be a “dark pool'' decentralized exchange project. A “dark pool” is considered to be an exchange in which financial assets are first matched and then traded on an order book that is private. 
REN tokens were originally used to pay for transactional fees and used as a bond by those running the Darknodes. The protocol rebranded itself in 2019 and focused on being a DeFi interoperability solution. Ever since then, REN is mainly used as a bond to operate the Darknodes. Darknodes function similarly to a validator node on a proof of stake blockchain.   
What problems does RenVM solve?
One of the major benefits that RenVM offers to the Ethereum network and DeFi sector is liquidity. Currently, there are plenty of bitcoin sitting around in users’ wallets and not earning any returns. With RenVM, there is a value exchange bridge for users to convert their bitcoin into an ERC-20 token equivalent. 
This ERC-20 token representing bitcoin is known as renBTC and can then be used on a wide selection of DeFi applications on Ethereum which includes features like lending, borrowing, trading and more. 
How does RenVM work?
The Ren network is built around the Ren virtual machine, RenVM. The RenVM is a network of computers called Darknodes, which behaves as facilitators to help complete the transaction generated by users. More specifically, Darknodes contribute their network bandwidth, computational power, and storage capacity to power the RenVM.
To qualify and operate as a Darknode, one needs to stake 100,000 REN as collateral. Darknode entities earn a portion of the transaction fees collected during the swap. The fees are paid in the form of cryptocurrency that is being traded. 
For example, it will cost users a fee to swap bitcoin to renBTC and the Darknode facilitator will be entitled to a portion of the fees. The fees involved in the transaction are paid in the form of bitcoin.

What are the differences between renBTC and WBTC?
With the Ren protocol, users are not required to go through a KYC process to swap bitcoin for renBTC. On the other hand, BitGo, the centralized custodian provider behind Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) requires users who want to wrap their bitcoin into WBTC to undergo a KYC process. 
BitGo holds the private keys to the bitcoin wallets and that automatically makes them a central point of failure. Conversely for REN, bitcoin is kept in a decentralized network of Darknodes in the Ren protocol and that helps mitigate the risk of being a central point of failure.
Users have to completely trust BitGo to safely store their bitcoin and honor the users’ redemption requests. In comparison to the Ren protocol, users do not have to worry about that because there is no authority to stop users from minting or redeeming their bitcoin. 
How to get REN?
Users can purchase REN from centralized and decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap, Coinbase and OKEx.
